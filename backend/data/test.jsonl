Employee Handbook**\n**Section 5.0: Leave Policies**\n**5.2 Paid Family Leave and Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision Number: 1.0**\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to supporting its employees during significant life events. This section outlines our policies regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**5.2.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nEmployees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) are eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits for up to eight (8) weeks to employees who take time off work to:\n\n*   Bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement)\n*   Care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling).\n\nThe wage replacement benefit is typically 60-70% of the employee's usual wages, subject to state-mandated limits. PFL is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Please refer to the EDD website (www.edd.ca.gov) for detailed information on eligibility requirements and benefit amounts.\n\n**5.2.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. Acme Corp. adheres to all requirements under the FMLA. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must:\n\n*   Have been employed by Acme Corp. for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive);\n*   Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave; and\n*   Be employed at a worksite where Acme Corp. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\nFMLA leave may be taken for the following reasons:\n\n*   Birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   Placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n**5.2.3 Coordinating PFL and FMLA**\n\nEmployees eligible for both PFL and FMLA may take both leaves concurrently where the qualifying reasons overlap (e.g., bonding with a new child in California). In situations where an employee in the state of California has been terminated from Acme Corp, and the employee's tenure was under 12 months, the employee is ineligible to apply for FMLA. In such cases, the employee should not be granted FMLA leave.\n\n**5.2.4 Return to Work**\n\nUpon returning from PFL or FMLA leave, employees are generally entitled to be restored to their original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nEmployees should consult with HR for specific guidance on leave eligibility and coordination."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_termination_ineligible_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In situations where an employee in the state of California has been terminated from Acme Corp, and the employee's tenure was under 12 months, the employee is ineligible to apply for FMLA.

(\"the Company\") is committed to compliance with all applicable state and federal laws regarding employee meal and rest breaks. This policy specifically addresses meal and rest break requirements for employees located in California. Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees; therefore, this policy applies solely to California employees and is governed by the California Labor Code, including but not limited to Sections 226.7 and 512. Nothing in this policy should be construed as creating a right to meal or rest breaks for employees outside of California. This policy supersedes any prior company policies relating to meal and rest breaks for California employees.\n\n**3.4.2 Meal Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt California employees shall be provided with a meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes for each work period totaling more than five (5) hours, unless the employee's total hours worked for that day are no more than six (6) hours, in which case the meal period may be waived by mutual written agreement between the employee and the Company. Further, if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, the employee shall be provided with a second meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes, unless the employee's total hours worked for that day are no more than twelve (12) hours, in which case the second meal period may be waived by mutual written agreement between the employee and the Company. The meal period shall be unpaid, and the employee must be completely relieved of all duties during this period. Employees are required to record their meal breaks accurately in the timekeeping system.\n\n**3.4.3 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt California employees shall be authorized and permitted to take a paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks shall be taken as near as practical to the midpoint of the four-hour work period.\n\n**3.4.4 Premium Pay for Missed Breaks**\n\nPursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7, if the Company fails to provide an employee with a meal or rest period in accordance with this policy, the Company shall pay the employee one (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided.

Notwithstanding any conflicting provisions within this policy manual, the provisions of this Section 3.12 shall govern the timing of final wage payments for California-based employees.\n\n3.  12.  2 Final Pay Distribution\n\nPursuant to California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, and subject to the conditions outlined below, employees who are involuntarily terminated from Global Dynamics Corp. shall receive their final paycheck, including all earned and unpaid wages, commissions, and accrued vacation time, immediately upon separation. However, where immediate payment is not feasible due to circumstances beyond the control of Global Dynamics Corp., such as payroll processing limitations, the final paycheck shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no case later than 72 hours following the termination.\n\nEmployees who voluntarily resign their employment must provide at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 advance notice of their intended resignation. Employees who provide such notice shall receive their final paycheck on their last day of employment. Employees who voluntarily resign without providing at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 advance notice shall receive their final paycheck within seventy-two (72) hours of their last day of employment. These requirements notwithstanding, salaried employees will have their final paycheck issued on the company's standard payroll date, provided that date is within 72 hours of their termination. This policy applies to California employees regardless of employment status, but is subservient to valid collective bargaining agreements. Global Dynamics Corp. reserves the right to pursue legal remedies for any damages incurred as a result of an employee's failure to provide adequate notice of resignation.

This policy outlines Starlight Technologies\u2019 obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.\n\nIt is Starlight Technologies' policy to comply with the federal WARN Act, which requires the company to provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff to affected employees. For the purposes of this policy, a \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment or 500 or more employees are affected.\n\nIf Starlight Technologies has fewer than 100 employees company-wide, we are exempt from the WARN Act requirements, and no such advance notice is required.

Additionally, employees working in California are also entitled to double their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in a single workday. It is important to note that if an employee has been working for the company for less than six months and has signed a voluntary waiver (see Appendix B, Section 4.5) regarding their right to daily overtime, this section may not apply and should be reviewed on a case by case basis with HR.

This policy governs the timing of final wage payments for employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. Notwithstanding any other provision in this manual, this section supersedes any conflicting federal policies regarding final wage payment timing for California-based employees.\n\n3.12.2 **Involuntary Termination**. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 201, if an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp., all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination shall be due and payable immediately at the time of discharge. The final paycheck must include all earned wages, including accrued and unused vacation time, pursuant to Acme Corp. Policy 4.02 regarding Vacation Accrual and Usage. This requirement for immediate payment is not applicable if the employee's employment status is not 'terminated', for example, if they are on a leave of absence, including but not limited to family, medical, or parental leave, as defined in Section 5.01.\n\n3.12.3 **Voluntary Resignation**. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 202, if an employee voluntarily resigns from Acme Corp., the timing of the final wage payment depends on the amount of notice provided. If the employee provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, the final wages are due and payable at the time of resignation. However, if the employee fails to provide at least 72 hours' notice, final wages are due and payable within 72 hours of the employee's last day of work. An employee's resignation does not constitute an involuntary termination.\n\n3.12.4 **Method of Payment**. All final paychecks will be disbursed in accordance with Acme Corp.'s standard payroll practices. Direct deposit shall continue to be the preferred method of payment, unless the employee specifically requests a paper check. Should an employee request a paper check upon termination, that request should be submitted in writing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"immediate payment of all wages due at the time of discharge\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 201, if an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp., all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination shall be due and payable immediately at the time of discharge.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_voluntary_resignation_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"payment of all wages due at the time of resignation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 202, if an employee voluntarily resigns from Acme Corp., the timing of the final wage payment depends on the amount of notice provided.

All decisions regarding workforce reductions will be made after careful consideration of operational needs and in compliance with applicable legal requirements. The following guidelines are applicable only for employees working in the state of California:\n\n*   **California WARN Act Applicability:** The California WARN Act applies to employers with 75 or more employees (full-time or part-time) in the preceding 12 months. A \"mass layoff\" under California law is defined as a layoff of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. Therefore, if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a single site of employment within California within a 30-day timeframe, the company is required to provide 60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government. This notice must contain specific information as required by the California WARN Act, including the reasons for the layoff, the expected date of the layoff, and the number of affected employees.\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act Applicability:** The federal WARN Act applies to employers with 100 or more employees (full-time or part-time).\n\n*   **Exceptions:** Certain exceptions to the WARN Act notification requirements may apply, such as unforeseeable business circumstances or natural disasters. Consult with the Legal Department for guidance on any potential exceptions. See also Section 9.0 (Employee Termination Procedures).\n\n**3.12.2: Coordination with Legal Department**\n\nThe HR Department, in conjunction with the Legal Department, is responsible for determining whether a planned workforce reduction triggers the notification requirements of the WARN Act or the California WARN Act. No workforce reduction plan involving the termination of 50 or more employees within California should be implemented without prior review and approval by the Legal Department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_mass_layoff\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a single site of employment within California within a 30-day timeframe, the company is required to provide 60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required. *However*, under certain documented circumstances approved by a supervisor, an employee may waive their second meal period provided that they do not work more than twelve (12) hours. The first meal period cannot be waived. As required by California law, Acme Corp. will pay one hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal period is not provided, and is not properly waived pursuant to the procedure outlined above. Refer to policy 3.2.3 for information about break tracking.\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks:** Non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid rest break of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of the work period, if practical. Please see Section 3.2.4 for rules concerning scheduling.\n\n**3.2.3 Break Tracking:** It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to accurately record all meal and rest breaks using the company\u2019s timekeeping system. Failure to record breaks properly may impact compliance with applicable wage and hour laws. See policy 5.1 concerning Timekeeping Procedures.\n\n**3.2.4 Break Scheduling:** Supervisors must make a good faith effort to schedule meal and rest breaks in accordance with this policy. Meal breaks should be scheduled no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth hour of work, and the second meal break, where applicable, no later than the end of the employee's tenth hour of

Employee Handbook**\n\n**Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks (Effective Date: 2024-01-01, Revision 1.2)**\n\n3.4.1. **Purpose:** This section outlines the Company's policy regarding meal and rest breaks for employees, pursuant to federal law. United Global Solutions, Inc. is committed to ensuring employee well-being and compliance with all applicable federal regulations. Nothing in this policy should be construed as creating any rights or obligations beyond those mandated by federal law.\n\n3.4.2. **Applicability:** This policy applies to all non-exempt employees of United Global Solutions, Inc. throughout the United States, subject to applicable federal law. Exempt employees are not subject to the provisions of this policy.\n\n3.4.3. **Meal Breaks:** In accordance with federal law, United Global Solutions, Inc. is not required to provide meal breaks. However, if United Global Solutions, Inc. elects to provide meal periods of thirty (30) minutes or more, such breaks will be unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities during the entirety of the break. If the employee is not completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities, the meal period will be considered working time and must be compensated accordingly. Employees who voluntarily choose to work during their scheduled meal period may do so, but will only be compensated if they have explicit prior approval from their supervisor or manager to perform work during that time. This policy also incorporates Policy 3.7 regarding overtime compensation, which requires that all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek be compensated at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\n3.4.4. **Rest Breaks:** United Global Solutions, Inc. is not federally required to provide rest breaks to adult employees. However, if a manager permits short breaks of five (5) to twenty (20) minutes, such breaks shall be paid. It is the expectation of United Global Solutions, Inc. that any break period is used responsibly to allow the employee to adequately refresh and to maintain an acceptable standard of performance.\n\n3.4.5 **Federal Break Provision:** Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, United Global Solutions, Inc. will allow a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break for any non-exempt employee if their shift.duration_hours is greater than five (5) hours."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_shift_duration\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"shift.duration_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, United Global Solutions, Inc. will allow a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break for any non-exempt employee if their shift.duration_hours is greater than five (5) hours.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

In order to trigger the WARN act requirements, Acme Corp must have at least 100 employees on staff. If Acme Corp has fewer than 100 employees, then the WARN Act notice requirements do not apply. In the event a mass layoff or plant closing is planned that will result in the termination of more than 50 employees as described above, Acme Corp HR will notify affected employees 60 days in advance of the action.

This policy outlines the procedures we follow in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, as defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and related state laws, specifically California's WARN Act.\n\nTo determine if the WARN Act applies to a particular situation, the following guidelines will be used. The federal WARN Act requires 60 days advance written notice if a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, provided the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. Please note that temporary employees, as defined in Section 1.4, and employees on approved leaves of absence, as defined in Section 4.1, may or may not be counted towards the 50-employee threshold depending on the specific circumstances and the guidance provided by legal counsel at the time of the event.\n\nIn California, the state WARN Act has slightly different requirements. If Sterling Fabricators Inc. employs 75 or more employees, the California WARN Act may be triggered if a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. In determining whether an event triggers the California WARN Act, all employees working in California are counted toward the 75-employee threshold. The HR department, in coordination with legal counsel, will be responsible for evaluating each situation to determine whether notification is required under either the federal or California WARN Act, or both.

Veridian Dynamics provides family and medical leave to eligible California employees pursuant to the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), where applicable.\n\n3.4.2. **California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**. An employee who contributes to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) as determined by the State of California and whose employment status is active, may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for a qualifying event such as to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law. Benefits under PFL are administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and provide partial wage replacement as determined by the EDD, but shall not exceed eight (8) weeks within a twelve (12) month period. This duration shall run concurrently with any unpaid leave taken under the federal FMLA.\n\n3.4.3. **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**. Eligible employees, namely those whose tenure_months equals at least twelve (12) months and employer.employee_count_within_75_miles equals at least fifty (50), may take up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a twelve (12) month period for qualifying reasons as defined under FMLA, including but not limited to the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member.\n\n3.4.4. **Coordination of Leave**. To the extent an employee is eligible for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves shall run concurrently. Acceptance of PFL benefits does not extend the maximum leave duration beyond the twelve (12) weeks provided by FMLA. However, pursuant to internal policy section 2.5 regarding short term disability, an employee may apply for such benefits if the leave involves the employee's own serious health condition after other leave options are exhausted."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\":

All non-exempt employees working in California are eligible for overtime pay as described below. This policy supplements Section 3.2.1 (Regular Hours and Pay) of this handbook.\n\nEmployees who work more than eight (8) hours in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek are entitled to overtime compensation. For hours exceeding eight (8) hours in a workday, or up to forty (40) in a workweek, overtime will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. However, should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they will be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond the initial twelve. Furthermore, employees who work more than eight (8) hours on their seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek shall also receive compensation at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding eight on the seventh day, provided such work is pre-approved by the employee's manager and documented properly in the employee's timesheet, in accordance with policy 3.5.2 (Timekeeping Procedures). Any hours worked exceeding forty in a week are calculated independently of the daily overtime calculations; therefore, overtime will only be paid once for each hour worked and the higher overtime rate will take precedence in cases where the employee qualifies for overtime under both daily and weekly calculations. For the avoidance of doubt, federal overtime provisions also apply; however, Veridian Dynamics will follow California state law in all cases where California law provides for a greater overtime benefit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_daily_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For hours exceeding eight (8) hours in a workday, or up to forty (40) in a workweek, overtime will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_daily_2x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 2\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they will be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond the initial twelve.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_weekly_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who work more than eight (8) hours in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek are entitled to overtime compensation.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_7th_day_2x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.consecutive_workdays\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 2\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Furthermore, employees who work more than eight (8) hours on their seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek shall also receive compensation at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding eight on the seventh day\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Overtime Compensation (California Employees)\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

However, If an employee working outside California is involuntarily terminated, Evergreen Solutions Corp. will provide the final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday, as required by federal law. Employees should contact the Human Resources department with any questions regarding their final paycheck. Please refer to Section 2.15 for details on our standard payday schedule.\n\n*   **Federal Compliance:** Evergreen Solutions Corp. will adhere to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding final paychecks for all employees, regardless of location.

This policy applies exclusively to employees working in California.\n\n4.  12.2. **Notification Requirement:** Notwithstanding any other policy to the contrary, in the event of a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation as defined under applicable law affecting employees working within the State of California, the Company shall provide written notice to affected employees at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the date of separation, provided that the conditions outlined below are met. The Company will also notify the California Employment Development Department (EDD) as required by law.\n\n5.  12.3. **California WARN Act Applicability:** The Company will adhere to the stricter requirements of the California WARN Act. Therefore, the notification requirements of Section 3.12.2 shall apply if either (a) the Company employs seventy-five (75) or more employees in California, or (b) the mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects fifty (50) or more employees within a 30-day period, regardless of whether those employees all work at a single site of employment. For purposes of determining the number of affected employees, employees on temporary layoff or leave of absence who have a reasonable expectation of recall shall be counted. Employees must also be actively employed, not terminated or resigned.\n\n6.  12.4. **Exemptions:** This policy does not apply to temporary employees hired with the understanding that their employment is limited to the duration of a specific project or season, provided that such understanding is clearly communicated to the employee at the time of hire.

This policy applies to all active employees of Innovision Corp., regardless of location, but provides specific guidance for employees working in California, given the state's more stringent requirements.\n\n**3.4.1 California Employees:** Pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, all non-exempt employees working in California shall be provided with a 30-minute unpaid meal break for each work period exceeding five (5) hours. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break shall be provided for work periods exceeding ten (10) hours. These meal breaks must commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work and tenth (10th) hour of work respectively. Furthermore, non-exempt employees working in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Employees are required to take all meal and rest breaks as required by law. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.\n\n**3.4.2 Employees Outside of California:** For employees located outside of California, Innovision Corp. will adhere to applicable federal law. Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Innovision Corp. chooses to provide short breaks (typically lasting five (5) to twenty (20) minutes), these breaks shall be considered paid time. Bona fide meal periods (typically thirty (30) minutes or more) need not be compensated when the employee is completely relieved of duty for the purpose of eating a regular meal.\n\n**3.4.3 Missed Breaks:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, in California, if a meal or rest break is not provided in accordance with Section 3.4.1, the employee shall be compensated with one (1) hour of premium pay for each missed meal or rest break.

Sunrise Technologies is committed to treating all employees with respect and dignity during any workforce reduction event.\n\n**WARN Act Notification Requirements:**\n\nSunrise Technologies is subject to both the federal and California WARN Acts, which require advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials in the event of a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation. The stricter of the two laws will be followed.\n\n*   **California WARN Act Thresholds:** Sunrise Technologies will provide 60 calendar days advance written notice if a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation occurs that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period and Sunrise Technologies employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons in California. This employee count includes full-time, part-time, and commissioned employees.\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act Thresholds:** Regardless of the California WARN Act's applicability, if Sunrise Technologies employs 100 or more employees (including full-time and part-time) and a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day notice will also be required, regardless of employee location state.\n\n*   **Exclusions:** Independent contractors and consultants who are not considered employees under applicable state and federal law are not counted towards these thresholds. Employees who are offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are also excluded, provided the employee accepts the transfer.\n\n*   **Notification Procedures:** In the event that a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation triggers the notification requirements under either the federal or California WARN Act, Sunrise Technologies will adhere to all applicable notification requirements, including providing written notice to affected employees, the California EDD, and local government officials. This notice will contain all information required by the WARN Act, including the date of the planned action, the reasons for the action, and contact information for company representatives.\n\nRefer to Policy 2.15 - Termination of Employment, for further details on separation procedures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_75_employee_threshold\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 calendar days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Sunrise Technologies will provide 60 calendar days advance written notice if a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation occurs that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period and Sunrise Technologies employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons in California.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_federal_100_employee_threshold\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60-day notice will also be required\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Regardless of the California WARN Act's applicability, if Sunrise Technologies employs 100 or more employees (including full-time and part-time) and a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day notice will also be required, regardless of employee location state.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_exclusion_independent_contractors\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"independent_contractor\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"independent contractors and consultants are counted towards employee threshold under WARN Act\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Independent contractors and consultants who are not considered employees under applicable state and federal law are not counted towards these thresholds.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_exclusion_transfer\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"mass_layoff\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employees offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are counted toward thresholds under WARN act.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who are offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are also excluded, provided the employee accepts the transfer.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reductions and WARN Act Compliance (California)\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave, complying with both federal and California law. Please note that eligibility requirements and benefit levels differ between the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL). Employees should consult with HR for individual clarification.\n\nEligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally entitled to participate in the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program. PFL provides partial wage replacement, typically between 60% and 70% of your usual wages, for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. This leave runs concurrently with any FMLA leave. For clarification, eligibility for PFL is determined by the State of California, not Acme Corp. Employees may also be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) if the employee has worked for Acme Corp. for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave.\n\nWhile FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, the amount of leave an employee is actually entitled to may be affected by any previous FMLA leave that has been used by the employee in the past 12 months. For employees who qualify for both FMLA and PFL, the leave will run concurrently. Note that FMLA is generally unpaid, with the exception of using accrued PTO or vacation time to offset some of the absence; while PFL is paid by the state and will not require using existing vacation time. Therefore, up to 8 weeks could be compensated by the state under PFL while the remaining 4 weeks of FMLA leave may be unpaid. It is imperative that employees review their specific circumstances with the HR department to confirm the exact amount of leave they can take and payment options."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Partial wage replacement for up to 8 weeks through CA PFL.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement_percentage\": \"60-70\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Eligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally entitled to participate in the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program.

Nothing in this policy shall be construed to provide greater benefits than those provided under applicable law.\n\n3.12.2. **Eligibility Requirements.** To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, and be employed at a worksite where the Company employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.

Employees eligible for California Paid Family Leave may also receive partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member, provided the employee contributes to SDI. The duration of paid leave under CA PFL is separate from, and does not extend, the 12-week unpaid leave entitlement provided under FMLA.\n\n3.12.4. **Concurrent Leave.** Where an employee qualifies for both FMLA and California Paid Family Leave, the leaves shall run concurrently to the extent permitted by law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, and be employed at a worksite where the Company employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, for California-based employees who contribute to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) fund, eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits shall be governed by applicable California law.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_leave_restriction_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"medical\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Paid family leave under California law, Cal.

Innovision Solutions, Inc. is committed to complying with all applicable federal and California state wage and hour laws. This section should be read in conjunction with Section 2.05, \"Wage Payment Schedule,\" and Section 4.10, \"Termination Procedures.\"\n\nThe timing of an employee's final paycheck is dependent on the nature of their separation from Innovision Solutions, Inc. and is governed primarily by California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202. In cases of *involuntary* termination, where an employee is discharged or laid off by Innovision Solutions, Inc., all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination are due and payable *immediately* at the time of termination. This includes, but is not limited to, accrued vacation time and any other earned compensation. However, if the employee's separation is deemed a voluntary resignation, the timing of the final paycheck becomes more nuanced.\n\nSpecifically, when an employee *voluntarily* resigns their position with Innovision Solutions, Inc., with at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 prior notice to their supervisor or the Human Resources Department, the final paycheck is due and payable at the time of resignation. Conversely, should an employee voluntarily resign without providing at least seventy-two (72) hours' notice, then final payment is due no later than seventy-two (72) hours following the employee\u2019s last day of work. Final paychecks may be picked up at the Innovision Solutions office at 123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 91234, or mailed to the employee's last known address. Please consult with the Human Resources Department for any questions regarding the timing or method of your final paycheck distribution.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.2: Overtime Compensation (California Employees)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision: 1.0**\n\nThis section outlines Acme Corp.'s policy regarding overtime compensation for non-exempt employees working in California. It is crucial that all employees and managers understand and adhere to these guidelines to ensure compliance with California labor laws. For California employees, overtime pay is provided for any hours actually worked. In most situations, the overtime rate is one and one-half times (1.5x) the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond eight (8) in a single workday or forty (40) in a workweek. However, if an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they are entitled to double their regular rate (2x) for all hours worked over the first twelve.\n\nAdditionally, the state of California has rules about working an extended number of days in a workweek. Any hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek, beyond eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day, also require compensation at double the employee\u2019s regular rate. Note that an employee will not be able to collect both daily and weekly overtime. Instead, Acme Corp. will pay whichever calculation results in the greater overtime amount. In cases where an employee works over 8 hours on a seventh consecutive day, the employee's hourly rate shall be calculated at 2x their normal rate for those hours. Please consult with the HR department (ext. 555) or refer to CA Labor Code Sections 510 and 515 for any clarification or specific questions, especially in unusual scenarios involving split shifts or alternative work schedules, as this policy is subject to change based on legal interpretations.

Such PFL benefits provide partial wage replacement, currently at a rate of sixty (60) to seventy (70) percent of the employee\u2019s usual weekly wage, up to a statutory maximum, for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks within any twelve (12) month period.\n\n5.  3.2. **FMLA Leave**: Eligible employees, as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq., working for Sterling Consolidated, Inc. at worksites where fifty (50) or more employees are employed by the company within seventy-five (75) miles of that worksite, and who have been employed by Sterling Consolidated, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked at least 1,250 hours for the company during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, are eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including but not limited to, the birth of a child, the adoption of a child, or to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition.\n\n6.  3.3. **Integration of PFL and FMLA**: For California employees eligible for both California PFL and federal FMLA leave for the same qualifying event (e.g., bonding with a newborn child), Sterling Consolidated, Inc. will administer these leaves concurrently. The employee shall initially utilize their PFL benefits, and the period of PFL leave will run concurrently with the employee's FMLA leave.

Because Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for employees aged eighteen (18) or over, Stellaris Technologies, Inc. is not required to provide such breaks. However, where Stellaris Technologies, Inc. voluntarily provides breaks of a short duration, specifically five (5) minutes to twenty (20) minutes in length, such breaks shall be considered \"rest periods\" and shall be compensated as time worked. Conversely, meal periods, defined as periods of thirty (30) minutes or more during which the employee is completely relieved of all duties, are not required to be compensated, provided the employee is, in fact, completely relieved of all duties. Determination of complete relief shall be made at the sole discretion of the employee's supervisor or manager, and the employee bears the responsibility of bringing any concerns about non-compliant break periods to the attention of Human Resources within five (5) business days of the alleged infraction. Moreover, failure to comply with these federal standards concerning paid rest periods can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Should any portion of an authorized meal period require an employee to conduct work duties, that said meal period is considered a rest period under federal standards. Employees must report any time worked to their supervisor for accurate record keeping.\n\nFurthermore, while Stellaris Technologies, Inc. endeavors to provide a work environment that complies with all applicable laws, employees are solely responsible for tracking their time and ensuring the accuracy of their timecards.

This policy outlines the company's procedures regarding workforce reductions that may trigger the requirements of the California WARN Act. This policy applies to all SparkleClean Inc. employees located in California.\n\nThe California WARN Act mandates that employers with 75 or more employees provide 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials before any \"mass layoff,\" \"plant closure,\" or \"relocation,\" as those terms are defined under the Act, affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. A mass layoff excludes terminations for cause, voluntary departures, or retirements. A plant closure occurs when an employment site is shut down, and 50 or more employees suffer an employment loss within a 30-day period. A relocation is the removal of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations of an employer to a different location 100 miles or more away.\n\nTherefore, if SparkleClean Inc. has at least 75 employees in California and plans a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period due to economic reasons, the company must provide 60 days advance written notice to the affected employees, the EDD, and the relevant local government officials.

Acme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable federal wage and hour laws regarding final pay. This policy applies to all employees of Acme Corp throughout the United States.\n\nGenerally, Acme Corp will provide a final paycheck to a terminated employee on the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination date. This paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including any accrued and unused vacation time (as described in Section 4.01, Vacation Policy). An employee's employment_status must be something other than *active* to trigger this final pay process. Employees classified as *exempt* or *non_exempt* will both receive final pay based on this policy. Regardless of whether the termination is *voluntary* or *involuntary*, the final paycheck will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday.\n\nFor purposes of clarity, the phrase \"regularly scheduled payday\" refers to the standard payday schedule established by Acme Corp, which is bi-weekly on Fridays. Any wages earned up to and including the date of termination will be included in the final paycheck. If an employee's final paycheck cannot be delivered via the employee\u2019s usual method of payment (e.g., direct deposit), it will be mailed to the employee's last known address as on file with the Human Resources department.

However, for employees whose primary work location is in California, overtime will also be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday, and for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. Compensation for hours worked over twelve (12) in a single workday will be two (2) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for California employees. Further, for those California employees, if an employee works more than eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day in a workweek, those hours will be paid at two (2) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Note that for the purposes of this policy, a \"workweek\" is defined as Sunday 12:00 AM to Saturday 11:59 PM. The calculation of the \u201cregular rate of pay\u201d will include all non-discretionary bonuses and other incentive compensation as required by applicable law. See Section 3.3 for policies related to meal and rest breaks, and Section 3.4 for rules related to shift scheduling.

However, the Company reserves the right to effect workforce reductions without advance notice when circumstances dictate, pursuant to the exceptions outlined below.\n\n3.4.2. **WARN Act Applicability:** Acme Corp. will adhere to the notification requirements of the federal WARN Act if a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment and represents at least 33% of the active employees at that site, or if a plant closing affects 50 or more employees regardless of percentage, provided that the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. For employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, notwithstanding the foregoing, the California WARN Act shall apply if a mass layoff, relocation, or termination affects 50 or more employees in a 30-day period, and if Acme Corp.'s total employment count is 75 or more employees company-wide. In such instances, Acme Corp. shall provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 calendar days prior to the date of the planned action. The determination of \"affected employees\" shall be made pursuant to the definitions contained in the relevant statutes and regulations. This 60-day notice period shall be waived only in circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as outlined in section 3.4.5.\n\n3.4.3. **Required Notice:** Should a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation trigger either the federal or California WARN Act, Acme Corp. shall provide written notice to all affected employees.\n\n3.4.4. **Exemptions:** [This section intentionally left blank].\n\n3.4.5. **Unforeseeable Business Circumstances:** Nothing in this policy shall prevent the company from invoking the unforeseen business circumstances exception under the WARN Act.

If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. The timing of rest breaks should be approximately in the middle of the four-hour work period.\n\nEmployees in certain positions that require constant manning of equipment, as defined in exhibit A, and who have an employee.tenure_months greater than 6 months may be exempted from the standard meal break rules. However, such employees must sign a waiver agreeing to an on-duty meal period and be compensated for that time.

HR Policy Manual**\n\n**Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks**\n*Effective Date: 2024-07-01, Revision 1.2*\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to providing employees with appropriate meal and rest breaks. Because Acme Corp. operates in multiple states, our policy must consider both federal and state laws. Where state law provides greater protection to employees than federal law, Acme Corp. will follow the more protective state law. This policy applies to all active employees except where superseded by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nFor employees working in California, if your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are eligible for a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, unpaid meal break. A second meal break of thirty (30) minutes is required if you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday. However, the second meal break may be waived by the employee if the total hours worked in the workday are no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal break was taken. You are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To clarify, a \"major fraction thereof\" means more than two hours. So, if an employee works 6 hours and 1 minute, they are entitled to two rest breaks.\n\nFor employees who are non-exempt and perform work outside of California, while federal law doesn't mandate meal or rest breaks, Acme Corp. provides employees a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break if the workday exceeds six (6) hours, or as otherwise required by applicable state law. All provided breaks between five (5) and twenty (20) minutes must be paid time.\n\nFailure to provide required meal and rest breaks can result in penalties.

The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, as defined by federal law.

Eligibility for California PFL requires that the employee contributes to California State Disability Insurance (SDI). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an employee is eligible for both FMLA and PFL and is taking leave to bond with a new child, the employee shall first utilize PFL benefits. If an employee's location_state is not \"CA\" but the employer's location_state is \"CA\" and employee meets all other federal criteria, the employee will only be eligible for federal FMLA leave only.

We strive to comply with both California Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** If you are a California employee who contributes to State Disability Insurance (SDI), you may be eligible for up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of your usual wages) through California\u2019s PFL program. This leave can be used to bond with a new child (within one year of birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). Eligibility for PFL benefits is determined by the State of California, not by Sterling Innovations.\n\n**Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave per 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Sterling Innovations for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive), have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and work at a location where Sterling Innovations employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. FMLA leave can be taken for the birth and care of a newborn child; placement of a child for adoption or foster care; to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or for your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job.\n\n**Coordination of PFL and FMLA:** If you are eligible for both PFL and FMLA for the same event (e.g., bonding with a new child), the leaves will run concurrently. This means the 8 weeks of PFL will count towards your 12 weeks of FMLA leave. However, if you are terminated while on family leave and you have already used 12 weeks of leave, you are not eligible to return to your position.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.2: Meal and Rest Breaks (California Employees Only)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision: 2.0**\n\nAcme Corp. recognizes the importance of providing employees with adequate meal and rest breaks. This policy applies solely to employees working within the state of California, and it adheres to applicable California Labor Laws. All non-exempt employees are entitled to meal and rest breaks as described below. Note that this policy supersedes any prior policy relating to break times.\n\n*Meal Breaks:* Employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are generally entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. Such meal breaks must commence before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work unless operations require as defined under CA Labor Code Section 512, the only exception being when the shift is no more than six hours, in which case the meal break can be waived by mutual consent between the employee and supervisor. Employees working shifts over ten (10) hours are typically entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break, which must commence before the end of the tenth (10th) hour of work. However, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and employee only if the total hours worked is no more than twelve (12) hours and if the first meal period was not waived. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during meal breaks.\n\n*Rest Breaks:* Non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, as is standard. Rest breaks should, to the extent possible, be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period. If, because of business necessity, a rest break cannot be provided, the employee may be eligible for a premium payment of one (1) hour of pay for each workday that such violation occurs, contingent on supervisory approval. Contact the HR department for further clarification.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at any time, at the discretion of Acme Corp. management.

This section outlines our Family and Medical Leave policies, adhering to both federal and California state laws.\n\n**3.5.1 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked for NovaTech Solutions for at least 12 months and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the start of the leave. Additionally, NovaTech Solutions must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA leave can be used for the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job. FMLA runs concurrently with other leaves where applicable. See Section 3.5.3 regarding interaction with California Paid Family Leave.\n\n**3.5.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nFor employees working in California who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI), California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits. Specifically, if you're a California employee paying into SDI, you may receive up to 8 weeks of paid leave at approximately 60-70% of your usual wages to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner), or participate in a qualifying event as defined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). This leave runs concurrently with FMLA where applicable, but the key difference is that PFL provides partial wage replacement while FMLA is unpaid.\n\n**3.5.3 Interaction of FMLA and PFL**\n\nWhen an employee qualifies for both FMLA and PFL for the same event, such as bonding with a new child, the leaves will run concurrently. This means that the 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave and the 8 weeks of partially paid PFL leave will overlap.\n\n**3.5.4 Requesting Leave**\n\nEmployees must provide NovaTech Solutions with advance notice of their intent to take family or medical leave, whenever possible. Requests should be submitted to the Human Resources Department using the designated forms and following the procedures outlined in Section 3.6 \"Leave Request Process\"."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Up to 8 weeks of paid leave at approximately 60-70% of your usual wages to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner), or participate in a qualifying event as defined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD).\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"leave.duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"compensation.percentage\": \"60-70\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, if you're a California employee paying into SDI, you may receive up to 8 weeks of paid leave at approximately 60-70% of your usual wages to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner), or participate in a qualifying event as defined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"NovaTech Solutions Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-03-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}
