As such, non-exempt employees will be compensated for overtime hours worked pursuant to the standards set forth herein and in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law.\n\n4.  2.  2 Overtime Compensation Calculation: For non-exempt employees located outside of California, overtime shall be calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) in a workweek. However, for non-exempt employees located in California, overtime compensation shall be calculated in accordance with California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein. Specifically, for California employees, overtime compensation will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) in a workday or forty (40) in a workweek. Employees who work more than twelve (12) hours in a workday or more than eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek shall be compensated at two (2) times their regular rate of pay. All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor, except in the instance of unforeseeable emergency. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy does not permit or authorize compensatory time off for overtime worked by non-exempt employees in California. Any violation of this Section may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Acme Corp is committed to providing employees with as much advance notice as possible in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. This policy applies only to Acme Corp employees working in the state of California.\n\n**California WARN Act:** California has its own version of the WARN Act, and it has stricter requirements than the federal version. California WARN act (CA WARN) rules apply if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees (either full-time or part-time) in California. If Acme Corp triggers a mass layoff which means laying off 50 or more employees at a single site of employment within any 30-day period, employees must receive written notice at least 60 days before the layoff date.\n\n**Federal WARN Act:** Even if the California WARN Act does not apply (e.g., Acme Corp has between 75 and 99 employees in California, and does not trigger a mass layoff as defined above), the federal WARN Act might. The federal WARN act applies if Acme Corp has 100 or more employees (either full-time or part-time) nationwide, and we are planning a mass layoff of 50 or more employees at a single site of employment during a 30 day period.\n\nTherefore, if Acme Corp has at least 75 employees in California, and is conducting a mass layoff of 50 or more employees at a single site, then we are required to notify affected employees at least 60 days prior to the layoff. This requirement is separate from, and in addition to, any severance or other benefits outlined in Policy 3.15, \"Termination Benefits.\" If Acme Corp has at least 100 employees company-wide, and conducts a mass layoff of 50 or more employees at a single site in California, then we are also required to notify employees at least 60 days in advance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\",\n            \"relocation\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"affected employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notification_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, if Acme Corp has at least 75 employees in California, and is conducting a mass layoff of 50 or more employees at a single site, then we are required to notify affected employees at least 60 days prior to the layoff.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\",\n            \"relocation\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notification_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If Acme Corp has at least 100 employees company-wide, and conducts a mass layoff of 50 or more employees at a single site in California, then we are also required to notify employees at least 60 days in advance.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

Pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515, Acme Corp. shall compensate eligible employees for overtime hours worked. Overtime shall be defined as all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any one workday or forty (40) hours in any one workweek. Notwithstanding the foregoing, hours worked beyond twelve (12) hours in any workday or for any hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek shall be compensated at twice the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\n3.4.2. **Exemptions:** Certain employees, based on classification, may be exempt from overtime provisions as defined under applicable California and federal law. The determination of exempt status shall be made in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California Labor Code Section 515 et seq., and will be detailed separately in the employee's offer letter or subsequent written notification.\n\n3.4.3. **Meal Periods and Overtime:** For purposes of calculating overtime, unpaid meal periods are excluded from hours worked. An employee who fails to take a duly scheduled and permitted meal period, and consequently works in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday due to the omission of the meal period, remains eligible for overtime compensation for those hours exceeding eight, provided the missed meal period was not due to the employee's voluntary decision without the express or implied consent of their supervisor. For clarity and to ensure compliance, all employees working shifts greater than five hours will have a 30-minute meal break scheduled. The company reserves the right to modify the schedule of the meal break, but the employee is still entitled to the meal break and must not be penalized for taking the required break.\n\n3.4.4 **Reporting Overtime:** All overtime hours must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor prior to being worked, except in circumstances involving unforeseen emergencies. Any employee who believes they are entitled to overtime pay must submit a request to their supervisor no later than close of business on the Monday following the workweek in which the overtime hours were worked, which will be verified by the Supervisor prior to payment. Any employee that is not classified as an Active employee per Section 2.1 of this policy will not be eligible for overtime, regardless of classification or hours worked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_ca_employees\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime compensation for hours exceeding 8 in a day or 40 in a week\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"This section applies solely to non-exempt employees physically working within the State of California.

This policy applies to all employees across the United States, in accordance with federal law. Should there be any questions regarding this policy, please consult the Employee Handbook section 1.2 or contact your HR representative.\n\nRegarding the timing of final paychecks, our standard procedure is as follows. If an employee's employment with Acme Corp terminates, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the final paycheck, which includes all accrued and unpaid wages, will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday, provided that all company property, including but not limited to laptops, mobile devices, and identification badges, has been returned to the company and properly checked in according to the procedures described in Section 2.5. This ensures accurate calculation and processing.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, and to ensure compliance with applicable federal standards, if an employee has worked fewer than 60 hours in the 12 months preceding termination, and if the employee's tenure at Acme Corp was less than 3 months, then the final paycheck may be issued within fourteen (14) days of the termination date.

This policy applies to all non-exempt employees of Acme Corp throughout the United States. Refer to Policy 3.1 for employee classification definitions.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility and Rate:**\n\nAcme Corp adheres to federal overtime regulations as stipulated in the FLSA. Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay for all hours worked exceeding 40 in a workweek. Overtime compensation will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. This policy is designed to ensure consistent application of overtime regulations across all Acme Corp locations within the United States and to comply with federal law.\n\n**3.4.2 Overtime Authorization:**\n\nAll overtime work must be authorized in advance by the employee\u2019s supervisor. Employees who work overtime without prior authorization may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. While Acme Corp recognizes that unforeseen circumstances may occasionally necessitate unscheduled overtime, employees are expected to communicate with their supervisors as soon as possible if overtime work is required. Failure to obtain prior authorization does not negate the employee\u2019s entitlement to overtime pay for hours worked exceeding 40 in a workweek, but it may result in disciplinary action.\n\n**3.4.3 Calculation of Overtime:**\n\nOvertime hours are calculated based on the total number of hours worked in a workweek, which is defined as a fixed and regularly recurring period of 7 consecutive days. The workweek begins at 12:00 AM on Sunday and ends at 11:59 PM on Saturday. Paid time off, such as vacation or sick leave, is not considered hours worked for the purpose of calculating overtime. If a non-exempt employee's hours_worked_weekly exceeds 40, the employee will receive 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for each hour over 40.\n\n**3.4.4 Recordkeeping:**\n\nAccurate recordkeeping of hours worked is essential for compliance with the FLSA. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their start and end times, as well as any break periods, in the company\u2019s timekeeping system. Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and approving employee time records on a weekly basis. Discrepancies in time records must be resolved promptly.\n\n**3.4.5 Policy Exceptions:**\n\nNo exceptions to this policy are permitted without the express written approval of the Vice President of Human Resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_pay_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employee_classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a non-exempt employee's hours_worked_weekly exceeds 40, the employee will receive 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for each hour over 40.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Overtime Compensation\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

We aim to provide a supportive and compliant environment for employees needing time off for qualifying family or medical reasons.\n\n**3.2.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nEligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be able to receive up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of your normal pay, as determined by the state) through California's PFL program. This benefit is for bonding with a new child (within one year of birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or caring for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). To be eligible for PFL, your employee.sdi_contributor status must be set to 'true' and your employee.location_state must be equal to 'CA'. The leave.type must be either 'bonding' or 'caregiver'. We encourage you to apply for PFL through the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\n**3.2.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nIn addition to California PFL, employees who have worked for Pacific Dynamics for at least 12 months (employee.tenure_months >= 12) and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months prior to the leave start date (employee.hours_worked_12_months >= 1250), and whose employee.employment_status is 'active', are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the FMLA. This only applies if Pacific Dynamics employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite (employer.employee_count_within_75_miles >= 50). FMLA leave can be used for the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job. Note: If you are eligible for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves may run concurrently, however, FMLA is unpaid while PFL provides partial wage replacement.\n\nEmployees whose employee.location_state is not 'CA' will need to refer to Policy Section 3.3 for state-specific leave policies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement through California PFL\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Eligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be able to receive up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of your normal pay, as determined by the state) through California's PFL program.

This policy applies to all non-exempt employees who work in California.\n\n**Meal Breaks:** Employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal period. This meal period should generally be taken before the end of the employee's fifth hour of work. However, if the total hours worked in a workday are no more than six (6) hours, the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employee and their supervisor. In situations where an employee is required to work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal period is required unless the total hours worked are no more than twelve (12) hours AND the first meal period was not waived. Failure to comply with this policy, where the employee's actions contribute to the missed break (e.g., rejecting a properly offered break, and reporting such refusal to GGT), may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Good faith efforts should be made to provide these breaks.\n\n**Rest Breaks:** For every four (4) hours worked (or major fraction thereof), non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest period. To be clear, this means employees working between 3.5 and 4 hours will receive a rest break. Rest breaks should, where feasible, be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period. However, the timing of the rest break may be adjusted to accommodate operational needs. If an employee demonstrates a consistent pattern of being unable or unwilling to take breaks, despite GGT\u2019s good faith efforts to provide such breaks, and these actions disrupt normal business operations, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nThis policy is subject to change with or without notice. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to stay informed of company policy.

This section outlines the procedures for determining the timing of the final paycheck.\n\n3.12.2. **Final Paycheck Timing:** Notwithstanding any conflicting interpretations or applications of state law, including but not limited to California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, the Company shall adhere to federal regulations regarding the issuance of final paychecks. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in Subsection 3.12.3, an employee's final paycheck, inclusive of all earned but unpaid wages, including accrued vacation time and other benefits legally required to be paid out upon termination, will be available on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's separation date. If, however, the employee has been employed for less than twelve (12) months and their employment status changes to terminated due to involuntary separation or resignation, and the employee has worked less than 20 hours per week on average over their total tenure with the company, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the separation. Definitions regarding \"earned but unpaid wages\" and \"accrued vacation time\" are outlined in Section 2.01 and Section 4.10 respectively.
