Generally, a final paycheck will be issued to a terminating employee on the next regularly scheduled payday following their last day of employment. This means that even if an employee is terminated involuntarily, or if they resign with or without notice, the final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time, will be paid on the next regular payday. This allows for accurate calculation of all wages due, including any bonuses, commissions, or other forms of compensation. The employee's manager must notify payroll immediately upon an employee's termination or resignation to ensure prompt processing. If an employee's employment status is not 'active', then the employee will be issued a final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled paydate. This applies regardless of whether the employee is salaried or hourly. Refer to Policy 3.2.1 for further information on pay schedules.

This policy is designed to align with federal regulations.

Any breaks that are 20 minutes or less, and during which the employee performs no work, are considered *paid* rest breaks. Any breaks of 30 minutes or more in length are considered meal breaks. Any employee that is younger than 18 may have additional break requirements per state and federal law.\n\nIf an employee's `employee.pay_type` is hourly and their `employee.shift_hours` is greater than 6, then Acme Corp. allows them to take one unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes during their shift. This break must be scheduled by the supervisor to ensure adequate coverage, and the employee must be completely relieved of all work duties during the break.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at Acme Corp.'s discretion.

Generally, a separating employee will receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday. This ensures accurate reconciliation of all hours worked and any outstanding deductions. To reiterate, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.4, final paychecks for terminated employees, as defined by the cessation of an employee's active employment status, will be issued no later than the next regularly scheduled payday after the final day of employment, but only if the employee's tenure is less than or equal to 60 months.

All non-exempt employees who work a shift of eight (8) or more hours are eligible for one (1) unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes in duration. The timing of this meal break should ideally be around the middle of the shift, however it should be agreed with your manager to ensure optimal coverage. If an employee voluntarily chooses to work through their meal break, that time is still considered hours worked and must be compensated accordingly. It is the employee's responsibility to record all time worked accurately, including any time spent working during a scheduled meal break, as detailed in Section 6.1 (Compensation) concerning accurate timekeeping practices. This policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.\n\n**3.5.2 Short Breaks**\n\nSterling Dynamics also allows for short breaks (5-20 minutes), and recognizes that if these breaks are offered, they must be fully paid, and the employee must be completely relieved of their duties.\n\n**3.5.3 Questions**\n\nEmployees with questions regarding this policy should contact their supervisor or the Human Resources Department for clarification."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"All non-exempt employees who work a shift of eight (8) or more hours are eligible for one (1) unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes in duration.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Meal and Rest Breaks\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

In cases of *involuntary* termination, where an employee is discharged or laid off by Innovision Solutions, Inc., all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination are due and payable *immediately* at the time of termination. This includes, but is not limited to, accrued vacation time and any other earned compensation. However, if the employee's separation is deemed a voluntary resignation, the timing of the final paycheck becomes more nuanced.\n\nSpecifically, when an employee *voluntarily* resigns their position with Innovision Solutions, Inc., with at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 prior notice to their supervisor or the Human Resources Department, the final paycheck is due and payable at the time of resignation. Conversely, should an employee voluntarily resign without providing at least seventy-two (72) hours' notice, then final payment is due no later than seventy-two (72) hours following the employee\u2019s last day of work. Final paychecks may be picked up at the Innovision Solutions office at 123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 91234, or mailed to the employee's last known address.

Labor Code \u00a7 1400 et seq. Acme Corp. is committed to providing employees with as much advance notice as reasonably practicable in the event of a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation. However, the Company reserves the right to effect workforce reductions without advance notice when circumstances dictate, pursuant to the exceptions outlined below.\n\n3.4.2. **WARN Act Applicability:** Acme Corp. will adhere to the notification requirements of the federal WARN Act if a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment and represents at least 33% of the active employees at that site, or if a plant closing affects 50 or more employees regardless of percentage, provided that the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. For employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, notwithstanding the foregoing, the California WARN Act shall apply if a mass layoff, relocation, or termination affects 50 or more employees in a 30-day period, and if Acme Corp.'s total employment count is 75 or more employees company-wide. In such instances, Acme Corp. shall provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 calendar days prior to the date of the planned action. The determination of \"affected employees\" shall be made pursuant to the definitions contained in the relevant statutes and regulations. This 60-day notice period shall be waived only in circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as outlined in section 3.4.5.\n\n3.4.3. **Required Notice:** Should a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation trigger either the federal or California WARN Act, Acme Corp. shall provide written notice to all affected employees.\n\n3.4.4. **Exemptions:** [This section intentionally left blank].\n\n3.4.5. **Unforeseeable Business Circumstances:** Nothing in this policy shall prevent the company from invoking the unforeseen business circumstances exception under the WARN Act.

This policy outlines the eligibility requirements, leave duration, and reinstatement rights afforded under FMLA. This policy applies to all Sterling Dynamics Inc. employees within the United States and is governed by federal law.\n\n**5.2.1 Eligibility:** An employee is eligible for FMLA leave if they have been employed by Sterling Dynamics Inc. for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and if Sterling Dynamics Inc. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. The 12 months of employment do not need to be consecutive. For the purpose of calculating the 12-month period, any time spent in active employment is considered. Employees are responsible for providing adequate documentation supporting their FMLA leave request.\n\n**5.2.2 Leave Duration and Reasons:** Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for the following reasons:\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth.\n*   The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement.\n*   To care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition.\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job.\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n**5.2.3 Termination During FMLA Leave:** While an employee is on FMLA leave, Sterling Dynamics Inc. maintains the employee's health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. However, if an employee fails to return to work upon exhaustion of their FMLA leave, and the reason for not returning is that the employee has sought or accepted other employment, the employee's employment with Sterling Dynamics Inc. will be terminated effective the day after the last day of approved FMLA leave.

This policy outlines the requirements for meal and rest breaks for all employees, taking into consideration the varying regulations across the states where we operate. This policy is intended to provide the minimum standards for compliance; where a collective bargaining agreement, or other applicable agreement, provides for more favorable terms, those terms will govern.\n\n**Meal Breaks:**\n\nEmployees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes. In California, if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes is required. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during meal breaks. In states other than California, the provision of meal breaks is at the discretion of the company based on business needs, but where provided, should be at least thirty (30) minutes in duration. The employer may agree to shorten the break to no less than 20 minutes, but only by employee waiver.\n\n**Rest Breaks:**\n\nEmployees in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, if practical, be taken in the middle of the work period. While federal law does not mandate rest breaks for adult employees, Acme Corp provides paid rest breaks in accordance with California law to all its hourly employees regardless of their location as a gesture of employee goodwill, and due to our belief in the importance of workforce wellness. However, these rest breaks are only for employees classified as hourly. Salaried (exempt) employees are not required to take rest breaks, although they may take them at their discretion. Failure to provide required meal and rest breaks in California will result in one hour of premium pay for each missed break.

This policy applies to all employees, but specific provisions vary based on location and employment classification. Where federal and state law differ, ClearSky Solutions will generally comply with the provision most beneficial to the employee unless doing so is economically infeasible, as determined by senior management.\n\nFor employees working in California, if you are a non-exempt employee and work more than five (5) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, commencing no later than the end of your fifth hour of work. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday. California employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. For example, if you work over 2 hours but less than 4 hours, you are entitled to a rest break.\n\nFor employees working outside of California, ClearSky Solutions will provide rest and meal breaks in accordance with federal law.

Pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq., and California Labor Code sections concerning mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, this policy outlines the requirements for providing advance notice to affected employees and relevant government entities.\n\n(a) **Federal WARN Act Compliance:** In the event of a plant closing or mass layoff as defined under the Federal WARN Act, where Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees company-wide, excluding part-time employees, the company shall provide at least sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees. A mass layoff under the Federal WARN Act means a reduction in force resulting in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees constituting at least 33% of the employees at the site, or 500 employees regardless of percentage.\n\n(b) **California WARN Act Compliance:** Notwithstanding subsection (a), for employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, a sixty (60) day notice period shall apply if Acme Corp. employs, or has employed within the 36 months preceding the date of the planned action, 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff, relocation or termination of a covered establishment occurs. A mass layoff under California law means a layoff during any 30-day period of 50 or more employees. If the employment loss is a result of a physical disaster or act of war, such as but not limited to an earthquake, flood, fire, storm, or terrorist attack, the notice requirements may be waived by the Vice President of Human Resources, subject to the requirements of Section 3.14(d). For purposes of this section, part-time employees shall be included in the count of total employees in California. Further clarifications on definitions can be found in Section 1.2.\n(c) The requirements of this Section 3.14 do not apply to temporary cessation of employment when work is expected to resume within six months, or when a employee is laid off, and recalled within six months.\n(d) Any exception granted by the VP of HR per Subsection (b) shall be documented and made available to any affected employee upon request."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_federal_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice to affected employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In the event of a plant closing or mass layoff as defined under the Federal WARN Act, where Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees company-wide, excluding part-time employees, the company shall provide at least sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\",\n            \"relocation\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 day notice period\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding subsection (a), for employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, a sixty (60) day notice period shall apply if Acme Corp. employs, or has employed within the 36 months preceding the date of the planned action, 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff, relocation or termination of a covered establishment occurs.

If 72 hours' notice is provided, the final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. If an employee fails to provide at least 72 hours' notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of employment.

This policy outlines the procedures for mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, ensuring that we provide adequate notice to affected employees. This policy applies to all Apex Corporation employees in the United States.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nThe Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires employers to provide advance notice of certain plant closings and mass layoffs. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for either (1) 50 or more employees if they make up at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment; or (2) 500 or more employees, regardless of the percentage of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment. \"Employment loss\" is generally defined as a termination, a layoff exceeding six months, or a reduction in hours of more than 50 percent during each month of any six-month period.\n\n**3.12.2 California WARN Act Considerations**\n\nIn addition to the federal WARN Act, Apex Corporation acknowledges that California has its own version of the WARN Act, often referred to as the California WARN Act. The California WARN Act applies to employers with 75 or more employees (both full-time and part-time) and requires 60 days' advance written notice before a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.\n\nTherefore, if Apex Corporation has 75 or more employees within California, and a layoff will impact 50 or more employees, affected employees are entitled to 60 days' notice of the layoff.

All managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that employees adhere to this policy. This policy does not apply to employees working outside of California or those classified as exempt. (See Section 2.1 for employee classification details.)\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nCalifornia law requires that non-exempt employees be provided with meal breaks. Employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This meal break must begin before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This second meal break must begin before the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during their meal breaks. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal breaks on their timesheets. Failure to record a meal break will be treated as if the meal break was not taken. If an employee's shift is no more than six hours, they may mutually consent with Acme Corp to waive their right to a meal period; however, such a waiver must be in writing.\n\nIf a non-exempt employee's shift is longer than 10 hours, and their hours worked daily are equal to 10, they are not eligible for a second meal break.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period, to the extent practicable. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during their rest breaks.\n\n**3.4.3 Missed Meal and Rest Breaks**\n\nIt is the policy of Acme Corp to provide all employees with legally compliant meal and rest breaks. In the event that a meal or rest break is not provided in accordance with this policy, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each missed break.

The Company will also notify the California Employment Development Department (EDD) as required by law.\n\n5.  12.3. **California WARN Act Applicability:** The Company will adhere to the stricter requirements of the California WARN Act. Therefore, the notification requirements of Section 3.12.2 shall apply if either (a) the Company employs seventy-five (75) or more employees in California, or (b) the mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects fifty (50) or more employees within a 30-day period, regardless of whether those employees all work at a single site of employment. For purposes of determining the number of affected employees, employees on temporary layoff or leave of absence who have a reasonable expectation of recall shall be counted. Employees must also be actively employed, not terminated or resigned.\n\n6.  12.4. **Exemptions:** This policy does not apply to temporary employees hired with the understanding that their employment is limited to the duration of a specific project or season, provided that such understanding is clearly communicated to the employee at the time of hire.

An employee\u2019s eligibility for overtime compensation is determined based on both daily and weekly hours.\n\n3.4.2. In accordance with California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515, and subject to the exceptions outlined in Section 3.4.5, non-exempt employees working in California will be compensated at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday or for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek. However, if an employee is over the age of 18 and has worked for the company continuously for less than 6 months and their employment status is not terminated, resigned, or laid off, they are eligible for overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate only for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek and not daily until they have reached the 6 month mark. For employees who *are* eligible for daily overtime, hours that trigger daily overtime will not be counted again toward weekly overtime.\n\n3.4.3. Double time, at two (2) times the regular rate of pay, will be paid for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on any seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek.\n\n3.4.4. Calculation of overtime pay will be based on the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay, as defined in Section 3.5 (Regular Rate of Pay).\n\n3.4.5. Certain employee classifications may be exempt from overtime pay requirements under California law. Please refer to Section 2.2 (Employee Classifications) and consult with the Human Resources Department for clarification on specific exemptions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.age\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 18\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"terminated\",\n            \"resigned\",\n            \"laid_off\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate for hours exceeding 40 in a workweek, but not for hours exceeding 8 in a workday\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"non-exempt employees working in California will be compensated at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday or for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek.

This meal break must begin before the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. Employees working shifts longer than ten (10) hours are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This second meal break must begin before the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during their meal breaks.

Acme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state laws concerning wage payment. Employees are encouraged to review this policy carefully.\n\nThe timing of your final paycheck depends on several factors, including your employment location and the reason for your separation from Acme Corp. Federal law (Fair Labor Standards Act) requires that a final paycheck be issued by the next regularly scheduled payday following your termination date. However, California law has stricter requirements for employees working in California. Therefore, for employees located in California, if your employment is involuntarily terminated (meaning you are fired or laid off), Acme Corp is required to provide your final paycheck, including all earned wages, immediately upon termination. This is to comply with California Labor Code Section 201. If, however, you resign from your position and you do *not* provide Acme Corp with at least 72 hours advance notice of your resignation, then your final paycheck will be available no later than 72 hours after your last day of employment.

It's important to understand that both federal and state laws apply, and this policy attempts to integrate both.\n\n**4.2.1 General Provisions**\n\nEligible California employees may be entitled to both unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and paid leave under the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave. If Acme Corp employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite, you may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child; to care for a seriously ill family member; or for your own serious health condition. Please note that California employees paying into State Disability Insurance (SDI) may also be eligible for PFL benefits.\n\n**4.2.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nFor California employees, the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program provides partial wage replacement benefits while taking time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. The amount of wage replacement is typically between 60% and 70% of your usual wages, up to a maximum amount set by the state. An employee\u2019s eligibility for PFL payments is governed by California law and is separate from eligibility for FMLA leave, so even if you do not qualify for FMLA (for example, due to Acme Corp not having enough employees, or you do not meet tenure requirements), if you pay into California SDI, you may still qualify for PFL benefits. We encourage you to apply for both FMLA and PFL concurrently where applicable. Please consult the California Employment Development Department (EDD) for the most up-to-date information on PFL eligibility and benefit amounts. While FMLA is unpaid, utilizing PFL could permit paid compensation to partially offset the unpaid absence.\n\n**4.2.3 Concurrent Leave**\n\nAcme Corp will generally require that any leave taken under California PFL run concurrently with any eligible FMLA leave. In cases where an employee qualifies for both PFL and FMLA, the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement will run simultaneously with the 8 weeks of PFL. This means if you are eligible for both, after 8 weeks you may need to return to work or go on unpaid leave for the remainder of the FMLA period."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For California employees, the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program provides partial wage replacement benefits while taking time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave.

This section outlines the company\u2019s policy regarding reductions in force, including compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The WARN Act is a federal law, and there is also a California version (\"California WARN Act\"). This policy applies to all Acme Corp. employees working in California.\n\n**3.12.1 Applicability of California WARN Act**\n\nThe California WARN Act requires employers like Acme Corp. to provide advance written notice to employees affected by mass layoffs, plant closures, or relocations. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. A \"plant closure\" occurs when an employer shuts down an operating unit that employs 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. A \"relocation\" involves moving a company\u2019s operations to a different location 100 miles or more away. Because Acme Corp. has more than 75 employees in California, if a planned layoff involves 50 or more employees in our California facilities over a 30-day period due to a plant closure, mass layoff, or relocation, the company *must* provide those affected employees with at least 60 days advance written notice of their termination. Note this California rule takes precedence over Federal WARN Act provisions because the California law has a lower employee count threshold for compliance (75 versus 100 at the federal level). This notice will include information about the expected date of termination, any available transition services, and contact information for relevant resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_employees\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Because Acme Corp. has more than 75 employees in California, if a planned layoff involves 50 or more employees in our California facilities over a 30-day period due to a plant closure, mass layoff, or relocation, the company *must* provide those affected employees with at least 60 days advance written notice of their termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Leave requests will only be considered if employee is currently employed by Sterling Dynamics.\n\n**4.5.2 Notice Requirements:**\n\nEmployees seeking PFL or FMLA leave must provide Sterling Dynamics with at least 30 days advance notice of the need for leave when the leave is foreseeable.

It is imperative that all managers and HR personnel adhere strictly to the provisions outlined below to ensure compliance with California Labor Code Sections 201-203.\n\n*   **Involuntary Termination:** When an employee is involuntarily terminated from employment at The Daily Grind Corp. within California, their final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, overtime compensation, and accrued, unused vacation time (subject to Policy Section 5.1 regarding vacation accrual caps), will be made available for pickup at the employee's worksite on their last day of employment. If this is not feasible, the final paycheck will be mailed to the employee's address of record, postmarked no later than 24 hours following the termination. However, should the employee request that the check be mailed (even if immediate pickup is possible), the timeframe of 24 hours post termination applies.\n\n*   **Voluntary Resignation:** Employees who voluntarily resign their position must provide at least 72 hours\u2019 advance written notice to their supervisor. If the employee provides the requisite 72 hours' notice, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. In cases of resignation without 72 hours' notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the employee's last day worked. This 72-hour period excludes weekends and holidays. Should the employee\u2019s final day fall on or before our normally scheduled payday, the final paycheck may be paid on the normal payday, if the employee did not provide 72 hours' notice.\n\n*   **General Provisions:** All final paychecks will include a detailed itemization of wages, deductions, and accrued vacation payout (if applicable), in compliance with California law. Any disputes regarding the amount of the final paycheck must be submitted in writing to the HR department within 30 days of receipt of the paycheck. This policy is intended to comply with California Labor Code Section 201-203 regarding timely payment of final wages, and applies only to employees whose primary work location is within the State of California."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeline\": \"available for pickup on the last day of employment, or mailed within 24 hours if pickup is not feasible or employee requests mailing\",\n          \"items_included\": \"all earned but unpaid wages, overtime compensation, and accrued, unused vacation time\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"When an employee is involuntarily terminated from employment at The Daily Grind Corp. within California, their final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, overtime compensation, and accrued, unused vacation time (subject to Policy Section 5.1 regarding vacation accrual caps), will be made available for pickup at the employee's worksite on their last day of employment.

This policy outlines the eligibility requirements and provisions for employees seeking unpaid, job-protected leave under FMLA. Note that this policy only covers leave under Federal guidelines. State-specific leave laws, such as California Paid Family Leave (PFL), are not covered by this policy. Employees working in states with leave laws more generous than FMLA may be eligible for the benefit under that state's law rather than this Federal policy. Please refer to the applicable state law for details.\n\n**Eligibility for FMLA Leave:**\n\nTo be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must meet ALL of the following requirements:\n\n*   Have been employed by OptiCorp for at least 12 months (employee.tenure_months gte 12). This employment does not need to be consecutive.\n*   Have worked for OptiCorp for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date the leave is to begin (employee.hours_worked_12_months gte 1250).\n*   Be employed at a worksite where OptiCorp employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles of that worksite (employer.employee_count_within_75_miles gte 50).\n\nIf an employee meets all of the above criteria, they are eligible for FMLA leave. However, if any of the above are not met, the employee is not eligible to take FMLA leave and will be terminated.\n\n**Reasons for FMLA Leave:**\n\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:\n\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n(Continued in Section 3.5)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave and will be terminated\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee meets all of the above criteria, they are eligible for FMLA leave.

In situations where an employee works both daily and weekly overtime, the greater of the two amounts will be compensated, but not both, it being the intent of this policy to avoid double compensation. The rate of overtime compensation shall be one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all overtime hours, except as provided in California law for hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday, or over eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive workday, which shall be compensated at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay. Furthermore, any employee whose employee.employment_status is terminated involuntarily and who has worked over 40 hours in a week shall not be entitled to the full payout of any accrued PTO.\n\n3.4.2. **Workweek Definition:** The StellarTech Solutions workweek is defined as commencing at 12:00 AM on Sunday and concluding at 11:59 PM on Saturday. This definition applies to all employees, regardless of location, unless superseded by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n3.4.3. **Exempt Employees:** This policy does not apply to employees who are classified as exempt under the FLSA or California law.

This policy is intended to comply with federal labor law, and should there be conflicts with state law because of an employee's location, federal law will be the guiding and primary enforcement rule.\n\n**3.2.3 Meal Breaks:** Federal law does not require employers to provide meal breaks for adult employees. However, Acme Corp understands that meal breaks are important for employee well-being and productivity. Therefore, for all hourly, non-exempt employees, Acme Corp provides an unpaid 30-minute meal break for any employee whose work shift lasts longer than six hours. To ensure proper staffing levels and operational efficiency, employees are expected to coordinate their meal break schedules with their supervisors. Meal breaks may not be skipped or shortened, as this can create operational difficulties for the team. Employees must be completely relieved of all work duties during their meal break. Engaging in any work-related activities, including answering emails or phone calls, is prohibited during the meal break. If an employee\u2019s shift is less than six hours, or if they are exempt from this policy, they will not be entitled to a 30-minute meal break. Please note that federal law requires that breaks of shorter duration (5-20 minutes) are considered paid time and employees must be compensated for this time.\n\n**3.2.4 Rest Breaks:** Federal law does not require employers to provide rest breaks for adult employees.\n\n**3.2.5 Policy Enforcement:** Any questions regarding this policy should be directed to the Human Resources department.

These policies are designed to ensure compliance with California labor laws. For clarification on any section or term found herein, consult section 1.0 on definitions. Note that this section applies *only* to employees physically working within the state of California.\n\n**3.2.1 Meal Breaks:** Employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break, during which they must be completely relieved of all duties. This break should ideally be taken before the end of the fifth hour of work, but under unusual operational circumstances, this may be extended to the end of the sixth hour, provided a written acknowledgement is signed, stating the reason for delay. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are generally entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. However, the second meal break may be waived *by mutual consent* between the employee and their supervisor if the total hours worked are no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal break was taken. It is each employee\u2019s responsibility to track their break times and to notify their supervisor if a break was missed or shortened for any reason. Any employee found intentionally or habitually failing to take required breaks will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Additionally, if an employee\u2019s record repeatedly shows missed or shortened breaks, even if the employee claims to have been willing to waive them, such instances may be considered a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action.\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks:** Employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.

It is our intention to fully comply with all applicable federal and state laws, including those specific to California. This policy applies to all active employees of Sterling Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Please refer to Section 1.2 (Definitions) for clarification of terms used herein.\n\n**3.4.1 General Guidelines**\n\nSterling Solutions, Inc. provides meal and rest breaks to employees as required by law. The following guidelines apply:\n\n*   **Federal Law:** Under federal law, Sterling Solutions, Inc. is not required to provide meal or rest breaks to employees. However, when breaks of short duration (usually lasting from 5 to 20 minutes) are offered, Sterling Solutions, Inc. will compensate its employees for such time. Any meal periods lasting 30 minutes or more will be unpaid, provided that the employee is completely relieved of their duties during the meal period.\n\n*   **California Law:** For employees working in California, California law mandates specific meal and rest break requirements. Employees are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break if they work more than five (5) hours in a workday. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Sterling Solutions, Inc. will follow all legal requirements regarding timing of these breaks.\n\n*   **Termination:** If an employee in California is not provided a required meal or rest break as mandated by California law, and it is demonstrated that this failure to provide the break was a willful violation by the company, that employee will be immediately terminated for cause and is ineligible for rehire at any Sterling Solutions, Inc. location. Any termination under this rule will be subject to review by the HR Director and Legal Counsel.\n\n*   **Recording Breaks:** All employees, especially those working in California, must accurately record their meal and rest breaks in the designated timekeeping system.\n\nQuestions regarding this policy should be directed to the Human Resources Department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"break_california_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"meal\",\n            \"rest\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"immediate termination for cause and ineligibility for rehire\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee in California is not provided a required meal or rest break as mandated by California law, and it is demonstrated that this failure to provide the break was a willful violation by the company, that employee will be immediately terminated for cause and is ineligible for rehire at any Sterling Solutions, Inc. location.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Meal and Rest Breaks\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "termination"}}

Whether you are resigning, being terminated, or unfortunately laid off, it's our commitment to ensure you receive your owed wages promptly.\n\nFor employees not in California, final paychecks will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's last day of employment, in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nHowever, California employees operate under stricter regulations, as defined by California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202. Specifically, if a California-based employee is involuntarily terminated (meaning they are fired or laid off), their final paycheck, encompassing all earned but unpaid wages, is generally due immediately upon termination. Note: \"Immediately\" is interpreted as within a reasonable timeframe, accounting for administrative practicalities. If the termination occurs outside of regular business hours or on a weekend/holiday, the payment will be available on the next business day. In addition, for California employees who resign, the timing of the final paycheck is contingent upon the notice provided. If an employee gives at least 72 hours of advance notice of their resignation, they are entitled to receive their final paycheck on their last day of employment. Conversely, if less than 72 hours' notice is provided, or no notice at all, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of work. Final paychecks will be mailed to the employee's address of record unless other arrangements are made. This policy is subject to change.

This policy is intended to comply with all applicable California state laws. Please note that this policy applies only to employees whose employee.location_state is 'CA'; overtime for employees working in other states is governed by the laws of those states and applicable federal law, as described in Section 3.3. All other Apex Solutions, Inc. policies apply in addition to, and not in lieu of, this policy.\n\n**Overtime Pay:**\n\nApex Solutions, Inc. provides overtime compensation to its non-exempt California employees as follows:\n\n*   **Daily Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday (employee.hours_worked_daily) and up to and including twelve (12) hours in any workday.\n\n*   **Double Time:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', they will be paid two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday (employee.hours_worked_daily).\n\n*   **Weekly Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', and they have not already received overtime pay under the Daily Overtime provisions, they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek (employee.hours_worked_weekly). Hours already compensated at the daily overtime rate are not included in the calculation of weekly overtime to avoid double-counting. This also applies for work that is not on the 7th consecutive day of the workweek.\n\n*   **Seventh Consecutive Day Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt', their employee.location_state is 'CA', and their employee.consecutive_workdays is not_in [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"], they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. All hours worked in excess of eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek will be paid at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\nEmployees are required to accurately record all hours worked each day.

This policy is intended to ensure compliance with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq. and California Labor Code Sections 1400 et seq.\n\n3.7.2 Definitions: For purposes of this policy:\n   (a) \"Mass Layoff\" means a reduction in force, not the result of a plant closing or relocation, which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if they comprise at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at that site, or 500 or more employees regardless of percentage of the active workforce.\n   (b) \"Plant Closing\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees.\n   (c) \"Relocation\" means the removal of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations of an employer to a different location 100 miles or more away.\n   (d) \"Employment Loss\" means (i) termination of employment, other than for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement; (ii) a layoff exceeding six months; or (iii) a reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during each month of any six-month period.\n\n3.7.3 Notification Requirements:\n   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this policy, if NovaTech Solutions, Inc. employs 75 or more employees within the State of California, and a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation occurs that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period, the Company shall provide written notice to the affected employees and the California Employment Development Department (EDD) at least 60 days prior to the date of the planned action. Such notice shall comply with the content requirements outlined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102 and California Labor Code Section 1401.

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave for California-based employees, aligning with both federal and California state regulations.\n\n**5.2.1 Eligibility and Entitlements:**\n\nEmployees working in California who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement, typically 60-70% of your usual wages, for up to eight (8) weeks within a 12-month period. This leave may be used to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner). The determination of eligibility for PFL benefits is made by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), not by Synergy Solutions, Inc. While receiving PFL, employees are generally not entitled to concurrently receive any additional Synergy Solutions paid time off; however, they may be able to supplement PFL payments with accrued vacation time.\n\nFurthermore, eligible employees may also be entitled to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have been employed by Synergy Solutions for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave. Synergy Solutions, Inc. adheres to FMLA regulations for employees who work at a worksite where the company employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. FMLA leave runs concurrently with California PFL whenever the leave qualifies under both laws. Employees are required to provide appropriate documentation to support their leave request, as outlined in Section 5.1 (General Leave Provisions).\n\n**5.2.2 Coordination of Leave:**\n\nThe duration of PFL and FMLA may run concurrently, where applicable. Therefore, in many cases, leave is paid for the first 8 weeks (through PFL, and possibly supplemented with vacation time) and unpaid for the following 4 weeks. In cases where leave is not job-protected by FMLA (e.g., due to employer size), leave under CA PFL may still be available, subject to SDI contribution and EDD eligibility, however Synergy Solutions, Inc. has no obligation to hold the employee's position."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_wage_replacement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Partial wage replacement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"percentage\": \"60-70%\",\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees working in California who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits.

This policy outlines the company's approach to meal and rest breaks for all employees. Note: This policy adheres to federal standards only and does not create additional rights beyond those mandated by federal law, or contradict the policy language in Section 3.1.\n\n**3.4.1 General Break Policy**\n\nAcme Corp provides break periods to afford employees relief from job duties; however, only hourly employees are eligible for paid break periods. While federal law does not mandate specific break times, Acme Corp seeks to provide reasonable accommodations. Unless otherwise determined by department leadership due to operational needs, hourly employees are eligible to receive one (1) paid rest break of approximately ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, to the extent practicable. If an hourly employee works a shift exceeding five (5) hours, they may be provided with an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes; salaried employees are also eligible for meal periods of at least 30 minutes, subject to the employee fully relinquishing their duties and responsibilities during the break.

For example, if an employee is terminated on a Tuesday and Acme Corp's regular payday is Friday, the final paycheck will be issued on that Friday.

Zenith Dynamics is committed to supporting its employees through significant life events while balancing operational needs.\n\n**3.12.1 Eligibility for Leave:**\n\nEmployees may be eligible for unpaid leave under the FMLA if they have been employed by Zenith Dynamics for at least 12 months, and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Zenith Dynamics employs over 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of various worksites, therefore meeting the FMLA employer size requirement. Please refer to Section 3.12.4 for details regarding the process for requesting leave.\n\nEmployees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) through payroll deductions may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. Under the PFL program, eligible employees may receive partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined under California law. Note, however, that if an employee is eligible for FMLA and uses PFL for bonding purposes, the PFL duration will run concurrently with their FMLA leave, meaning it counts toward the 12 weeks of unpaid leave under FMLA. The actual duration of available FMLA and PFL may be affected by applicable disability periods associated with the leave reason; employees should consult with HR and, if appropriate, their medical provider.\n\n***Important Note Regarding Consecutive Leave:** If an employee is on continuous leave for any reason (including, but not limited to, disability, FMLA, or PFL) exceeding 26 weeks, Zenith Dynamics may require medical certification to verify the employee's ability to return to work before reinstating employment. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with legal counsel and the employee's direct manager.*\n\n**3.12.2 Leave Entitlements:**\n\nFMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for the employee's own serious health condition. California PFL provides eligible employees with up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. PFL does not provide job protection; however, if the leave qualifies for both FMLA and PFL, the employee's job is protected under FMLA during the duration of the combined leave, up to 12 weeks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_pfl_duration_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement\": \"partial\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) through payroll deductions may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits.

See Section 1.02 for the definition of \"wages.\"\n*   **California Employees - Voluntary Resignation with 72 Hours Notice:** If you voluntarily resign from your employment with Acme Corp in California and provide Acme Corp with at least 72 hours advance notice of your resignation, you will receive your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, on your last day of employment.\n*   **California Employees - Voluntary Resignation without 72 Hours Notice:** If you voluntarily resign from your employment with Acme Corp in California and do *not* provide at least 72 hours advance notice of your resignation, you will receive your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, within 72 hours of your last day of employment.\n*   **Employees Outside of California:** For employees working outside of California, final paychecks will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's termination date, as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nAcme Corp will make every reasonable effort to ensure that your final paycheck is accurate and compliant with all applicable laws. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your final paycheck, please contact the Human Resources Department immediately."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_involuntary\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Provide final paycheck immediately upon termination.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you are involuntarily terminated from your employment with Acme Corp in California (meaning Acme Corp ended your employment), you will receive your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, *immediately* upon termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_voluntary_72_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Provide final paycheck on last day of employment.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you voluntarily resign from your employment with Acme Corp in California and provide Acme Corp with at least 72 hours advance notice of your resignation, you will receive your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, on your last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_voluntary_less_72_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Provide final paycheck within 72 hours of last day of employment.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you voluntarily resign from your employment with Acme Corp in California and do *not* provide at least 72 hours advance notice of your resignation, you will receive your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, within 72 hours of your last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_non_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Issue final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's termination date.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees working outside of California, final paychecks will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's termination date, as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "final_paycheck", "rule_type": "termination"}}

The timing of your final paycheck is dependent on several factors, including your employment status at the time of separation and adherence to company policies as outlined in Section 2.1 (\"Attendance and Punctuality\") and Section 3.2 (\"Resignation Procedures\").\n\nFinal compensation will include all earned and unpaid wages, including but not limited to regular wages, accrued vacation time (as per Section 3.5, \"Vacation and Paid Time Off\"), and any applicable bonuses. To avoid delays, employees must ensure their current mailing address is on file with Human Resources.\n\nXYZ Corp. adheres to federal law regarding final paycheck disbursement. Generally, employees whose employment is terminated by XYZ Corp., or who voluntarily resign from their positions, can expect to receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following their last day of employment. However, this is contingent upon the accurate and timely submission of all required paperwork, including but not limited to timesheets and expense reports. Employees who are terminated for gross misconduct, as defined in Section 6.4 (\"Disciplinary Action\"), may experience a delay in receiving their final paycheck pending the completion of any internal investigation.

This policy is intended to comply with all applicable federal and state laws regarding meal and rest periods. Where federal and state law differ, Sterling Consolidated will adhere to the law most beneficial to the employee.\n\n3.4.2 **California Employees:** Pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, all non-exempt employees working in California are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break when their total daily work period is more than five (5) hours. If the daily work period is more than ten (10) hours, the employee is entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. Such meal breaks must commence no later than the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work and tenth (10th) hour of work, respectively. Further, all non-exempt employees in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. No employee shall work for a period of greater than four (4) hours without receiving a rest break. If an employee's hours_worked_daily is less than 3 hours, no rest breaks are required.\n\n3.4.3 **Employees Outside of California:** For non-exempt employees working outside of California, Sterling Consolidated will comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding meal and rest breaks. In the absence of a specific state law mandating meal or rest breaks, employees are expected to manage their work schedules in a responsible and professional manner. While federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees, should the company elect to provide breaks shorter than 20 minutes, those breaks will be considered paid time.\n\n3.4.4 **Waivers:** Meal break waivers may be permitted under California law where the total daily hours worked are no more than six (6) hours.

Eligibility for each leave type differs, and employees may be eligible for one or both concurrently.\n\n**4.2.1 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must:\n\n*   Have been employed by Sterling Consolidated for at least 12 months.\n*   Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the start of the leave.\n*   Be employed at a worksite where Sterling Consolidated employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\n**4.2.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides eligible employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) with up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of wages) when they take time off work to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. An employee is eligible for PFL if they are an active employee located in California, contributes to SDI, and are requesting leave for a qualifying reason such as bonding with a new child within one year of the child's birth or placement, or caring for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling. Leave for one's own serious health condition is not covered by PFL and would instead be addressed under Sterling Consolidated's disability leave policies and/or FMLA where eligibility requirements are met.\n\nAn employee's employment status must be `active` to qualify for PFL. If an employee is terminated, resigned, or laid off, they are no longer eligible for PFL even if they have accrued benefits. Note that the hours worked requirements and employer size requirements for FMLA do not apply to California PFL, but the SDI contribution requirement and the \"active\" employment status *do* apply.\n\n*See also: Section 4.3: Disability Leave Policies.*"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must:\\n\\n*   Have been employed by Sterling Consolidated for at least 12 months.\\n*   Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the start of the leave.\\n*   Be employed at a worksite where Sterling Consolidated employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"California PFL benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"An employee is eligible for PFL if they are an active employee located in California, contributes to SDI, and are requesting leave for a qualifying reason such as bonding with a new child within one year of the child's birth or placement, or caring for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling.

Acme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable laws.\n\nGiven the stricter requirements in California, this policy primarily addresses the California WARN Act. If Acme Corp has 75 or more employees (full-time or part-time) in California and plans a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that would affect 50 or more employees within a 30-day period, we are required to provide written notice 60 days in advance. A mass layoff is defined as a reduction in force that is not caused by a plant closing or relocation and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.2: Overtime Compensation (California Employees)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision: 1.0**\n\nThis section outlines Acme Corp.'s policy regarding overtime compensation for non-exempt employees working in California. It is crucial that all employees and managers understand and adhere to these guidelines to ensure compliance with California labor laws. For California employees, overtime pay is provided for any hours actually worked. In most situations, the overtime rate is one and one-half times (1.5x) the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond eight (8) in a single workday or forty (40) in a workweek. However, if an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they are entitled to double their regular rate (2x) for all hours worked over the first twelve.\n\nAdditionally, the state of California has rules about working an extended number of days in a workweek. Any hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek, beyond eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day, also require compensation at double the employee\u2019s regular rate. Note that an employee will not be able to collect both daily and weekly overtime. Instead, Acme Corp. will pay whichever calculation results in the greater overtime amount.

This policy is governed by the California Labor Code Sections 201-202. In circumstances where federal law provides different requirements, Sterling Dynamics will endeavor to comply with state law.\n\nUpon separation from employment, the timing of your final paycheck depends on the reason for separation and the amount of notice provided, if any. For any employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Sterling Dynamics, all wages earned and unpaid are due and payable immediately at the time of termination. As further clarified in Section 3.2.A below, immediate payment will be provided at the worksite, provided that Sterling Dynamics is reasonably able to comply.\n\nIf an employee voluntarily resigns, the timing of the final paycheck depends on whether the employee provides at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation. If at least 72 hours' notice is provided to their supervisor, the final paycheck, which must include all earned and unpaid wages, will be available on the employee's last day of employment. Employees who resign without providing 72 hours\u2019 notice will receive their final paycheck within 72 hours of their last day of employment. As per Section 1.4 (Definitions), business days exclude weekends and nationally recognized holidays. While Sterling Dynamics will use reasonable efforts to comply with these requirements, in rare cases and due to extenuating circumstances, final pay may be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the termination date. In cases of dispute, employees should consult with Human Resources for clarification.\n\n**Section 3.2.A: Immediate Payment Exceptions**\n\n\"Immediate\" payment at the worksite is subject to practical constraints. Sterling Dynamics will make every good-faith effort to comply, but if, for instance, payroll processing cannot be completed on site or if the employee's termination occurs outside of normal business hours, the payment will be mailed or made available for pickup at the corporate office no later than 24 hours after the termination."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n

This section outlines our policy regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\nEmployees working within the state of California who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, per CA statute, to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. PFL provides partial wage replacement, currently at 60-70% of your usual pay, for up to eight (8) weeks. Eligibility for PFL is determined by the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\nSeparately, and regardless of location, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by federal law. FMLA eligibility requires you to have worked for Veridian Dynamics for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the twelve (12) months preceding the leave. This applies only if Veridian Dynamics employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\nIn California, Veridian Dynamics generally coordinates these leaves. If an employee is eligible for both FMLA and PFL for the same qualifying event, the leaves typically run concurrently. However, FMLA leave is unpaid, except when the employee uses accrued paid time off benefits, and PFL benefits will then be paid by the State of California EDD to eligible employees. Employees outside of California will only be eligible for FMLA leave if they meet the federal requirements described above. Refer to policy 3.2.1 regarding PTO accrual and usage. Employees will be required to take the leave in full week increments; unless otherwise agreed upon with management in writing.

This policy governs the payment of overtime compensation to non-exempt employees.\n\n3.4.2. **Overtime Eligibility.** Non-exempt employees shall be eligible for overtime compensation as set forth in this Section 3.4. Overtime compensation shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for employees whose employee.location_state is California, overtime compensation shall also be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday.\n\n3.4.3. **California Overtime.** Pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515, if employee.location_state is California, employees are entitled to overtime pay at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in a workday, or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day of a workweek.\n\n3.4.4. **Calculating Overtime.** Overtime shall be calculated on a weekly basis, except as otherwise required under California law for employees whose employee.location_state is CA. The employee.hours_worked_weekly is expected to not exceed 60 hours weekly, without written permission from the employee's manager and HR department. Any such approval is subject to revocation at any time. If an employee works less than eight (8) hours in a workday and their employee.age is less than 18, no overtime is accrued for that day, regardless of weekly hours worked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_standard_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime compensation at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt employees shall be eligible for overtime compensation as set forth in this Section 3.4.

Federal law generally dictates that final paychecks must be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday. However, California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 provide specific requirements for the timing of final wage payments. Therefore, this policy is tailored to comply with California law for all active California employees.\n\nFinal paychecks for employees who voluntarily resign must be available no later than 72 hours after their last day of work, provided that reasonable notice of their intent to resign has been provided. *Reasonable notice* is defined as providing at least 72 hours advance notice. Should an employee fail to provide such notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the employee\u2019s last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns with less than 72 hours' notice but specifically requests their final paycheck to be available on their last day of work, Apex Industries will endeavor to accommodate this request where feasible, but cannot guarantee its fulfillment, and payment will be issued no later than 72 hours after the last day.\n\nIn cases of involuntary termination, including layoff, final paychecks will be made available to the employee immediately upon separation. The final paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including any accrued and unused vacation time (refer to Section 4.5, Vacation Policy). If an immediate paycheck is impossible due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., payroll processing limitations, system outages), Apex Industries will make every effort to provide the final paycheck as soon as possible, but no later than is legally permissible under applicable state laws. Questions regarding the payment of final wages should be directed to the HR department.

This policy is effective January 1, 2024, and supersedes all prior policies regarding meal and rest breaks for California employees. Revisions to this policy will be communicated to employees in writing.\n\n**3.4.2 Scope:** This policy applies exclusively to non-exempt employees working within the State of California. Exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law, are not subject to the provisions of this policy. The provisions outlined herein are intended to comply with California state law, which governs break requirements. Federal guidelines do not apply to this policy because California law is more protective of the employee.\n\n**3.4.3 Meal Breaks:** All non-exempt California employees shall be provided with a meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes when their total shift exceeds five (5) hours, except when the total hours worked are no more than six (6) hours, and the employee and employer mutually agree to waive the meal period. For shifts exceeding ten (10) hours, a second meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes shall be provided, unless the total hours worked are no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during any meal break. A non-exempt employee will be paid one hour of premium pay for a missed meal break.\n\n**3.4.4 Rest Breaks:** Non-exempt California employees are entitled to a paid rest period of ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To clarify, the rest break shall commence no later than the end of the fourth hour of work. To the extent practicable, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of the four-hour work period. The company will pay one hour of premium pay for each missed rest break.\n\n**3.4.5 Waiver of Meal Period:** Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.4.3, if an employee's shift is no more than six (6) hours and the employee and the employer mutually consent in writing, the meal period may be waived.\n\n**3.4.6. Premium Pay:** Per 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 above, if an employee does not receive the required meal or rest period, Acme Corp. shall pay the employee one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_waiver_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"mutual written consent between employee and employer to waive meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3.4.3, if an employee's shift is no more than six (6) hours and the employee and the employer mutually consent in writing, the meal period may be waived.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Furthermore, employees working in California shall be compensated at twice (2) their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday, or for all hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek.

Eligibility for PFL is contingent upon the employee contributing to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) through payroll deductions. Specifically, only employees whose `employee.sdi_contributor` status is designated as `true` shall be considered for PFL benefits. Furthermore, eligibility for FMLA requires that the employee has been employed by StellarTech Solutions, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months (`employee.tenure_months` gte 12) and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave (`employee.hours_worked_12_months` gte 1250).

While FMLA leave is generally unpaid, PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits, typically sixty to seventy percent (60-70%) of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage, up to a statutory maximum. The maximum duration for California PFL is eight (8) weeks (`leave.duration_weeks` lte 8) within a twelve-month period for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. FMLA provides for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave.

This policy applies *only* to employees whose primary work location is in the state of California. Employees working outside of California are subject to the meal and rest break policies applicable to their work location. This policy does not create any contractual rights. Sterling Consolidated reserves the right to modify or terminate this policy at any time, with or without notice, consistent with applicable law.\n\n**3.2.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nEmployees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. Employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break, unless they have worked less than twelve (12) hours and both the employer and employee mutually waive the second meal period. To comply with California law, and unless an employee's primary work location is outside of California, non-exempt employees are required to take a meal break when working over five hours, and are only permitted to waive their second meal break when all conditions are met: the shift is under twelve hours, and the agreement to waive the meal break is mutual. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during their meal breaks. Any employee who is not relieved of all duty during a meal break must be paid for that time. See Section 3.5 for rules regarding recording of hours worked.\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nEmployees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.

This policy is intended to comply with both California state law and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In the event of a conflict between this policy and applicable law, the law will govern. For any questions regarding this policy, please contact the HR Department.\n\n**3.2.1 Overtime Eligibility**\n\nThis policy applies to all non-exempt employees working in California. Exempt employees, as defined under both California and federal law, are not eligible for overtime pay. Please refer to Section 2.1 (\"Employee Classifications\") for clarification on exempt vs. non-exempt status.\n\n**3.2.2 Overtime Compensation for California Employees**\n\nNon-exempt employees in California are entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday, or forty (40) hours in a workweek. The overtime rate will be one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For example, if your regular hourly rate is $20 per hour, your overtime rate would be $30 per hour. If an employee works less than 8 hours on any given day, but exceeds 40 hours for the week, they are still entitled to overtime pay for those hours exceeding 40. No overtime pay will be granted if the employee's tenure is less than 3 months. For further clarification on how your total hours are calculated, please refer to policy 3.3 (\"Time Keeping\").\n\n**3.2.3 Double Time Compensation**\n\nCalifornia law also mandates double-time pay (two times the regular rate of pay) for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday, and for all hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.\n\n**3.2.4 Approval Required**\n\nAll overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor or manager.

This policy is intended to comply with the Federal WARN Act and does not create any additional rights or obligations beyond those outlined in the federal statute.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notice Requirements**\n\nThe WARN Act requires Acme Corp. to provide 60 calendar days advance written notice to affected employees before a plant closing or mass layoff if the company has 100 or more employees, not counting employees who have worked less than 6 months in the last 12 months or employees who work an average of less than 20 hours a week. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and at least 33% of the employees (excluding part-time employees), or 500 or more employees (regardless of the percentage of total employees). Therefore, if Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees and a mass layoff as defined above is planned, then the company is required to provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 days in advance of the layoff.

Employee Handbook**\n\n**Section 3.14: Workforce Adjustment Notification (WARN) Policy**\n**Revision Date: 2024-07-01**\n**Effective Date: 2025-01-01**\n\nIt is the policy of Sterling Dynamics to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.) for all employees across the United States. This policy aims to provide employees with advance notice in the event of a covered plant closing or mass layoff as defined by the WARN Act.\n\n*   **General Notification Requirement:** Sterling Dynamics will provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of any covered plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment during any 30-day period. This notification requirement applies if the employer has 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n*   **Definitions:** For the purposes of this policy, a \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if these employees represent at least 33 percent of the employees (excluding part-time employees) at the single site of employment. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n*   **Exceptions:** There may be circumstances where the 60-day notice is not feasible due to unforeseeable business circumstances, natural disasters, or a faltering company. In such cases, Sterling Dynamics will provide as much notice as is practicable and will provide a statement explaining the reasons for reducing the notification period. If an employee is being terminated for cause or performance reasons, or if they are retiring voluntarily, these actions will not be counted towards the mass layoff count for WARN purposes. The term 'part-time employee' here is defined as someone who works less than 20 hours per week, or who has been employed for less than six of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is required.

Additionally, employees working in California are also entitled to double their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in a single workday. It is important to note that if an employee has been working for the company for less than six months and has signed a voluntary waiver (see Appendix B, Section 4.5) regarding their right to daily overtime, this section may not apply and should be reviewed on a case by case basis with HR.

In compliance with both federal and California state law, overtime pay is required for all non-exempt employees under certain conditions.\n\nGenerally, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) mandates overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. However, for employees located in California, California law provides for daily overtime. Specifically, non-exempt employees in California are entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, up to twelve (12) hours. Furthermore, California employees are entitled to double time pay (two times the employee's regular rate of pay) for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday or for all hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.\n\nTherefore, to summarize, if you are a non-exempt employee working in California, and your employee.hours_worked_daily exceeds eight (8) hours, you may be entitled to overtime, subject to the daily and weekly limitations described above. For non-exempt employees not in California, overtime is calculated based solely on hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. Any questions regarding overtime eligibility or calculation should be directed to the Payroll Department, referencing Section 3.2.4 of the Employee Handbook and any applicable state and federal regulations.

This section outlines our policies regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for California-based employees.\n\n**3.4.2.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible employees who take time off work to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member, as defined in Section 3.4.6 (Definitions). This benefit is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). If an employee is making contributions to State Disability Insurance (SDI), they *may* be eligible for California Paid Family Leave. Whether an employee is eligible can be determined by consulting with the Human Resources Department on a case-by-case basis. If the employee is approved for California Paid Family Leave, it may be necessary to exhaust all other accrued time off benefits (sick, vacation) or other leaves (short-term disability) before PFL will be granted. Further, any overlapping leave of absence, as defined by HR policy 5.1.1b, must be reviewed by the leave of absence specialist.\n\n**3.4.2.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons, subject to the eligibility requirements outlined below.

This policy applies to all employees whose primary work location is within the state of California and outlines the interaction between these two laws.\n\n*   **FMLA Leave:** Eligible employees, defined as those who have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave, and where Acme Corp employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite, are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the FMLA for qualifying reasons. These reasons include the birth or adoption of a child, the serious health condition of the employee or a qualifying family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty or call to active duty status.\n\n*   **California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may also be eligible for California PFL benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of wages, as determined by the State of California) for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). Importantly, PFL runs concurrently with FMLA leave for the same qualifying event. Therefore, an employee who takes 8 weeks of PFL to bond with a new child will simultaneously use 8 weeks of their available 12 weeks of FMLA leave. The remaining 4 weeks of FMLA leave may be used for other qualifying reasons within the same 12-month period. However, if an employee takes 12 weeks of FMLA leave, they are not necessarily entitled to PFL benefits, they must qualify separately based on SDI contributions and qualifying reason under CA state rules. FMLA only guarantees job protection. Employees should consult the Employee Service Center for guidance.\n\n*   **Relationship between FMLA and PFL:** While FMLA provides job protection, it is unpaid. PFL provides partial wage replacement, but doesn't necessarily extend the duration of FMLA beyond 12 weeks. For the purpose of clarity, employees may only utilize both concurrently.

The workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM.\n\nSpecifically, if a non-exempt employee's *employee.hours_worked_weekly* exceeds 40 hours, then that employee will receive 1.5x their regular rate of pay for each hour exceeding 40.

Failure to adhere to this overtime policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n**3.2.4 Approval**\n\nAll overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor. Unauthorized overtime may not be compensated.\n\n**3.2.5 Record Keeping**\n\nAccurate record keeping of all hours worked is the responsibility of each employee.

Further, overtime is paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any one workweek. Compensation at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay is required for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday and for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek. Any questions regarding overtime eligibility or calculation should be directed to the Payroll Department. See Section 3.5 for information on timekeeping requirements. Failure to accurately record all hours worked may result in disciplinary action.

SparkleClean Inc. is committed to complying with all applicable federal and state laws concerning employee compensation. This policy applies to all non-exempt employees working in the United States.\n\n\"Non-exempt\" employees are those employees who are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and are entitled to overtime pay. Generally, these are hourly employees. Please refer to Section 2.1 (Employee Classifications) for a more detailed explanation of exempt and non-exempt status.\n\nOvertime pay is earned when a non-exempt employee works more than a specified number of hours in a workweek or workday. The standard workweek at SparkleClean Inc. is defined as Sunday through Saturday. Overtime pay is calculated based on the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay, which includes all forms of compensation paid to the employee.\n\nFor employees working in California, the following overtime rules apply. An employee will be paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, up to and including twelve (12) hours in a workday, and for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. An employee will be paid two times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday and for all hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. So, for example, if an employee in California works 10 hours in a day, they will be paid 8 hours at their regular rate, 2 hours at 1.5 times their regular rate.\n\nFor non-exempt employees who work in a state other than California, overtime pay at one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is required for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. This reflects the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nSparkleClean Inc. requires pre-approval from a supervisor for any overtime work. Any employee working overtime without prior approval may be subject to disciplinary action."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_daily_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5 times regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees working in California, the following overtime rules apply.

This policy outlines the procedures Synergy Corp. will follow in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation.\n\nIn the event Synergy Corp. anticipates a plant closing or mass layoff as defined below, Synergy Corp. will provide written notice at least sixty (60) calendar days in advance of the date of termination to affected employees. For the purposes of this policy, a \"plant closing\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) if the employees represent at least 33 percent of the active workforce at the single site of employment; or 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) are affected.\n\nHowever, for employees working in California, Synergy Corp. will comply with the California WARN Act, which requires notification if 50 or more employees are affected by a plant closure, mass layoff, or relocation.

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees located in the United States. In the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that meets the criteria outlined below, Acme Corp will adhere to the notification requirements mandated by the WARN Act. For clarification on terms used in this policy, please refer to Section 1.0 of this policy manual, Definitions.\n\n**WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nAcme Corp is required to provide 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment if Acme Corp employs 100 or more employees. The term \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if they comprise at least 33 percent of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees regardless of percentage. A plant closing is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. This notice will be provided to affected employees, their representatives (if any), the State Workforce Agency, and the chief elected official of the local government. This policy is intended to ensure compliance with the federal WARN act and is not intended to create any contractual rights.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nThe Human Resources Department is responsible for determining whether a planned workforce reduction triggers WARN Act notification requirements and for coordinating the preparation and distribution of required notices. All managers are responsible for immediately informing the Human Resources Department of any planned workforce reductions that may meet the criteria outlined in this policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action.

However, when breaks of short duration (usually lasting from 5 to 20 minutes) are offered, Veridian Dynamics will compensate employees for that time. Meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) do not need to be compensated as long as the employee is completely relieved of all job duties.\n\n*   **California Employees:** Employees working in California are subject to the following specific regulations:\n    *   Any non-exempt employee who works more than five (5) hours in a workday is entitled to an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes. Unless the employee\u2019s total hours worked for the work day are no more than six (6) hours, an employee can waive this meal period, provided that the waiver is voluntary.\n    *   A second unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes is required if a non-exempt employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. This second meal period can be waived only if the employee works no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived.\n    *   Non-exempt California employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, in a workday. Rest breaks should be taken, as much as is practicable, in the middle of each four-hour work period.\n    *   If Veridian Dynamics fails to provide a required meal or rest period to a non-exempt employee in California, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest period is not provided, as required by California law.\n\n*   For purposes of clarity, all references to \u201cnon-exempt employees\u201d in this policy refer to employees who are classified as non-exempt from overtime pay requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. See Section 2.1, Employee Classification, for further details.\n\n**3.4.2 Responsibilities**\n\nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to record meal and rest breaks accurately in the company\u2019s timekeeping system. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that employees have the opportunity to take their meal and rest breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_break_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"provide unpaid meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Any non-exempt employee who works more than five (5) hours in a workday is entitled to an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_second_meal_break_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"provide second unpaid meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"A second unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes is required if a non-exempt employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_rest_break_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"provide paid rest break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"rest\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt California employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, in a workday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_premium_pay_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"pay one (1) hour of premium pay\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If Veridian Dynamics fails to provide a required meal or rest period to a non-exempt employee in California, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest period is not provided, as required by California law.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Veridian Dynamics Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "leave"}}

This policy provides eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying family and medical reasons. It is our goal to support employees facing difficult personal or family circumstances while maintaining operational efficiency. Please note that this policy is governed exclusively by federal law, and Sterling Dynamics does not offer any state-specific family leave benefits at this time. For detailed definitions of terms used in this policy, refer to Section 1.2 of this handbook.\n\n**3.4.2 Eligibility for Family and Medical Leave**\n\nAn employee is eligible for FMLA leave under the following conditions, assuming that Sterling Dynamics employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. However, if an employee's tenure with Sterling Dynamics is less than twelve months at the time the leave is requested, *and* if, during those twelve months, the employee has not worked at least 1,250 hours, then FMLA leave may not be approved, and the decision on whether the leave is job-protected will be made at the sole discretion of Human Resources, with consideration given to the specific circumstances and impact on business operations. This is especially true if the employee's role is deemed critical to ongoing projects. See Section 3.4.4 regarding required documentation. This policy is subject to change without notice.\nFMLA leave requests must be submitted 30 days in advance when the need is foreseeable.\n\n**3.4.3 Qualifying Reasons for Leave**\n\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave for the following reasons:\n\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n**3.4.4 Requesting Leave and Providing Documentation**\n\nEmployees requesting FMLA leave must complete the appropriate leave request form and provide supporting documentation as required.

This policy outlines the Company's procedures for providing advance notice to affected employees in the event of such actions, adhering to the minimum requirements set forth by federal law. This policy applies to all Sterling Dynamics, Inc. employees within the United States.\n\n3.12.2. **WARN Act Notification Requirements:** The Company shall provide at least sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined below, to affected employees, their representatives (if any), the state dislocated worker unit, and the chief elected official of the local government. For the purposes of this policy, the terms \"plant closing\" and \"mass layoff\" shall be defined as specified in the WARN Act. Specifically, a \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force, other than a plant closing, which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees, excluding any employees who are part-time employees as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act. For clarification, this policy is governed by the *federal* WARN Act; notwithstanding the foregoing, state-specific WARN Acts with lower employee count thresholds shall not be applied. Should a reduction in force affect less than 50 employees at a single site of employment, or should those employees be part-time, no WARN Act notice is required under this policy. The Company shall maintain records demonstrating compliance with this policy.

This policy outlines our compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**Eligibility:** To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Acme Corp. for at least 12 months (which don't need to be consecutive), must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and the company must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA leave provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave during any 12-month period for the birth and care of a newborn child, for placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition, or when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition.\n\nFor purposes of determining eligibility, \"employed by Acme Corp.\" means actively employed. Therefore, employees whose employment status is 'terminated', 'resigned', or 'laid_off' are not eligible for FMLA leave. If an employee's employment status changes to one of these ineligible statuses *while* on FMLA leave, their leave will cease immediately and they will be subject to the termination procedures outlined in Section 5.0 of this policy manual. Employees should refer to Section 3.15 for information on other leave types that may be available if they do not qualify for FMLA. Employees are also responsible for notifying HR within one business day of any change that would impact their FMLA eligibility.\n\nIt is important to note that FMLA leave is unpaid leave.

This policy outlines the provisions for Family and Medical Leave, in accordance with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, where applicable.\n\n**3.4.2 Eligibility**\n\nEmployees may be eligible for leave under either FMLA or CA PFL, depending on their individual circumstances and the specific requirements of each law. FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked for ClearPath Solutions for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Furthermore, ClearPath Solutions must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite.\n\n**3.4.3 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nIn California, employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are also eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). California PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks to employees who take time off work to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner). To be eligible for CA PFL at ClearPath, employees must work in California, actively pay into the State Disability Insurance fund, and take leave to either bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member as defined by California law. If the employee's leave type is not parental or caregiver, the employee will not be granted paid family leave.\n\n**3.4.4 Relationship Between FMLA and PFL**\n\nEmployees may be eligible for both FMLA and PFL simultaneously. In such cases, the leaves will run concurrently, meaning the time off counts towards both the 12 weeks provided by FMLA and the 8 weeks provided by PFL. Because FMLA leave is unpaid, employees may utilize California PFL to receive partial wage replacement during a portion of their FMLA leave, specifically when that leave is taken for bonding or caregiver purposes.\n\n**3.4.5 Notice Requirements**\n\nEmployees must provide ClearPath Solutions with at least 30 days' advance notice of the need for FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When the need for leave is unforeseeable, employees must provide notice as soon as practicable. Please refer to Section 3.4.6 for detailed instructions on how to request leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_eligibility_bonding\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"parental\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"California Paid Family Leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement\": \"60-70%\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In California, employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are also eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).

This means that your final paycheck will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following your termination or resignation, as detailed in Section 3.1.\n\nHowever, for employees whose primary work location is in California, a different rule may apply. California Labor Code Section 201 and 202 dictates specific requirements for the timing of final paychecks. If an employee working in California is involuntarily terminated, their final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, must be provided to them immediately at the time of termination. If a California-based employee voluntarily resigns and provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, their final paycheck must be available to them on their last day of employment. If a California-based employee resigns without providing 72 hours' notice, their final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day worked. Note that these California requirements do not apply to those employees whose primary work location is not in California.

This policy outlines the company\u2019s requirements regarding these breaks, considering both federal and California state laws.\n\n**3.4.1 General Provisions**\n\nFederal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Acme Corp. chooses to provide short breaks (5 to 20 minutes), these breaks must be paid. Meal breaks of 30 minutes or more are generally unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties during the break. In California, however, the law requires very specific provisions regarding meal and rest breaks.\n\n**3.4.2 California Specific Provisions**\n\nEmployees working in California are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break if they work more than five (5) hours in a workday. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Additionally, California employees are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to take these breaks. If a non-exempt employee works in California and their shift hours are greater than 5, AND they are *not* classified as exempt, then they are eligible for an unpaid 30 minute meal break. Please consult the \u201cExempt vs. Non-Exempt Classification\u201d section of this handbook (Section 2.2) for further clarification on employee classifications.\n\n**3.4.3 Break Waivers**\n\nUnder certain circumstances, California employees may waive their meal breaks. Please see Section 3.5 for more information on meal break waivers.\n\n**3.4.4 Missed Breaks**\n\nAny employee who is required to work through their meal break or rest break due to business necessity must immediately notify their supervisor.

Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. These meal breaks must begin before the end of the fifth hour and tenth hour of work, respectively. Employees can waive their meal break if working no more than six (6) hours in a day, and if mutually agreed upon with the employer.\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Employees are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period, as practicable.\n*   **Premium Pay for Missed Breaks:** If an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, the employee is entitled to one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest break is missed. Please see Section 3.4.3 for instructions on reporting missed breaks.\n\n**3.4.3 Reporting Missed Breaks:**\n\nAny employee who believes they have been denied a compliant meal or rest break should immediately report the missed break to their supervisor or Human Resources.

To the extent that any provision of this policy conflicts with applicable California law, California law shall govern.\n\n3.4.2 **Meal Breaks:** Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 512, all non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours shall be provided with a meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes. This meal period shall commence no later than the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work, unless the employee's total shift does not exceed six (6) hours and the employee and employer mutually agree to waive the meal period. A second meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday; however, this second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and employee if the total hours worked does not exceed twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during meal periods. Failure to provide a required meal period shall result in one (1) hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal period is not provided. Employees working remotely, but still within California, are also subject to this policy.

Rest periods shall, insofar as practicable, be in the middle of each four-hour work period. Failure to provide a required rest period shall result in one (1) hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that a rest period is not provided.\n\n3.4.4 **Enforcement:** Any employee who believes they have been denied a meal or rest break in violation of this policy should immediately report the matter to their supervisor or to the Human Resources Department.

A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for either (i) 500 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees; or (ii) 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees, if those employees represent at least 33% of the employer\u2019s active workforce at the single site of employment.\n\n* **Notification Requirement:** Apex Dynamic Solutions will provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of any covered plant closing or mass layoff to affected employees, as well as to the appropriate state and local government entities. However, if the employer's total headcount is less than 100 employees, taking into account the specific circumstances, and where a mass layoff impacts fewer than 500 employees, notification will not be required under this section. All notices shall contain the information required by the WARN Act. See policy section 3.2.5 (Notice Procedures) for specific instructions on providing notice.\n\nApex Dynamic Solutions retains the right to modify this policy at any time.

This policy outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff.\n\nA \"plant closing\" refers to the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if these 50 or more employees make up at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees regardless of the 33% threshold. For avoidance of doubt, a \"single site of employment\" can refer to either a single physical location or a group of contiguous locations.\n\nGlobalCorp will provide written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff to affected employees and relevant government entities as required by law. While federal WARN requires employers with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days' notice, California's WARN Act (Cal-WARN) has different requirements.

It's important to understand the interplay between federal and state laws, especially FMLA (Federal Family and Medical Leave Act) and California PFL (Paid Family Leave). Because TitanCorp recognizes the value of our team members and strives to comply with all relevant laws, we offer leave options based on eligibility.\n\nFederal FMLA generally provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a seriously ill family member. More details on FMLA eligibility can be found in Section 3.4(a). However, California PFL offers a benefit unique to California: partial wage replacement while you take time off. Specifically, if an employee's request for bonding leave is approved, or leave to care for a seriously ill family member, and they contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI), then they may be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of paid family leave, receiving approximately 60-70% of their usual wages as determined by California's Employment Development Department (EDD). It is important to note that SDI contributions are mandatory for most California employees. Therefore, any leave type falling under CA PFL that is not already covered by company-provided benefits, such as short-term disability (STD), will not be covered, even if the request might otherwise have been approved. For clarity, Section 3.4(c) further details the conditions pertaining to company-provided STD. Employees are encouraged to contact HR with any questions regarding FMLA, PFL, or company STD options."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_sdi_leave_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"caregiver\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"parental\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"leave request under CA PFL\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, any leave type falling under CA PFL that is not already covered by company-provided benefits, such as short-term disability (STD), will not be covered, even if the request might otherwise have been approved.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"TitanCorp Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "restriction"}}

This section outlines the procedures regarding reductions in force, mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations. Please refer to Section 1.0 for definitions of key terms.\n\n**3.14.1 WARN Act Notification**\n\nAcme Corp will comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (both federal and California state laws) when implementing a qualifying plant closing or mass layoff. To the extent that federal and California WARN Acts conflict, the company will adhere to the standard most beneficial to impacted employees. This can be complex, so if a triggering event is anticipated, HR will immediately consult with Legal to confirm compliance.\n\nGenerally, if Acme Corp has at least 100 employees company-wide, a federal WARN notice is required if there is a plant closing affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment or a mass layoff affecting at least 50 employees comprising at least 33% of the workforce at a single site, or 500 employees at a single site, all within a 30-day period. However, in California, a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single worksite within a 30-day period triggers California's WARN Act if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees in total, irrespective of where the employees are located, including those on temporary layoff or leave. So, if Acme Corp has at least 75 employees but less than 100 employees across all of its locations, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a California worksite within a 30-day window, then California's WARN Act notice requirements are triggered.\n\n**3.14.2 Notification Timeline**\n\nAs required by federal and California WARN Acts, Acme Corp will provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 calendar days prior to the date of the plant closing or mass layoff. Notice will also be provided to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and any applicable local government.\n\n**3.14.3 Exemptions**\n\n[Further sections covering exemptions, voluntary separations, and benefit continuation omitted for brevity.]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of mass layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"So, if Acme Corp has at least 75 employees but less than 100 employees across all of its locations, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a California worksite within a 30-day window, then California's WARN Act notice requirements are triggered.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

We aim to comply with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, but interpretation and application can be complex.\n\n**3.12.1 General Provisions**\n\nEligible employees working in California are generally entitled to take leave for qualifying family or medical reasons, subject to the conditions outlined below. Please note that eligibility for FMLA and PFL may differ. It is the employee's responsibility to understand the requirements of each.\n\n**3.12.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL) and Interplay with FMLA**\n\nCalifornia employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement (currently 60-70% of your usual earnings) for up to eight (8) weeks to care for a seriously ill family member, or to bond with a new child. To be eligible for PFL while also remaining in active employment status, which allows for reinstatement to your position upon return from leave, your tenure at Acme Corp must be 12 months or less. In cases where an employee has been employed for more than twelve (12) months and contributes to SDI, that employee is ineligible to take PFL and retain active employment status. See Section 3.12.5 for information regarding FMLA leave. Please note that the Company may require medical certification to support a leave request under PFL. Section 3.14 covers return to work rights for employees following any period of leave.\n\n**3.12.3 Notice Requirements**\nEmployees must provide at least 30 days' advance notice of the need for leave when the need is foreseeable.

We are committed to supporting our employees' needs to care for their families and manage personal health matters.\n\n**5.2.1 Eligibility Overview**\n\nSterling Innovations complies with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL). It's important to understand that FMLA provides *unpaid*, job-protected leave for up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or the employee's own serious health condition. FMLA applies to employees who have worked for Sterling Innovations for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before the leave, and if Sterling Innovations has 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite.\n\nCalifornia PFL, on the other hand, provides *partial wage replacement* (currently 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). To be eligible for CA PFL, you must contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI). Employees who are not SDI contributors are not eligible for PFL benefits, even if they are eligible for FMLA. If you work in California, you likely contribute to SDI, but please confirm this on your paystub. You may take PFL to care for family members NOT residing in California, so long as you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements. Note that, depending on the timing and overlap between FMLA and PFL, FMLA runs concurrently with PFL where applicable.

It applies to all non-exempt employees working within the United States. Please note that this policy is governed by federal law, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For clarification on employee classifications (exempt vs. non-exempt), please refer to Section 2.1 of this manual. This policy does *not* cover state-specific regulations.\n\n**3.2.2 Overtime Rate:** Non-exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek will be paid overtime at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for each hour exceeding 40 hours. \"Regular rate of pay\" includes base hourly rate plus any nondiscretionary bonuses earned during the workweek.\n\n**3.2.3 Overtime Authorization:** All overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee's manager. Working unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their hours worked each day, including any overtime hours.

A covered establishment includes any industrial or commercial facility or part thereof that employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons. Therefore, if Synergy Corp. has 75 or more employees company wide and is conducting a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation impacting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment in California, then 60 days advance notice is required, regardless of the total Synergy Corp employee count. If the affected employees are not located in California and Synergy Corp. has fewer than 100 employees company wide, then neither federal nor California WARN apply, and the 60-day notification is not required.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks (California Employees)**\n**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01\n**Revision:** 2.0\n\nThis policy outlines Acme Corp.'s requirements for meal and rest breaks for employees working in California, in accordance with California Labor Law. Federal law has no bearing on these rules for adult employees. All California employees are entitled to meal and rest breaks as described below. This policy is intended to comply with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, as well as relevant Wage Orders.\n\n**Meal Breaks:**\n\n*   Employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes. This meal break must begin before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work.\n*   Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes. This second meal break must begin before the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work.\n*   Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during their meal breaks.\n*   Employees may voluntarily waive their meal break, subject to certain conditions, as described in Section 3.4.1 of this policy. The employee and manager must sign a form to document this agreement.\n\n**Rest Breaks:**\n\n*   Employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period, as reasonably as possible.\n*   Employees must be relieved of all duties during their rest breaks.\n\n**Premium Pay for Missed Breaks:**\n\nIf Acme Corp. fails to provide an employee with a compliant meal or rest break, the employee shall be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest break is not provided. Premium pay shall be paid at the employee's regular rate of pay.

This policy applies to all employees of Sterling Dynamics, Inc. across the United States.\n\nSterling Dynamics, Inc. is committed to treating its employees with respect and dignity. In the event that a workforce reduction becomes necessary, the company will strive to provide as much advance notice and support as possible, while ensuring compliance with applicable federal laws.\n\n**3.7.1 WARN Act Notice Requirements:**\n\nThe federal WARN Act requires covered employers to provide 60 calendar days' advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff to affected employees. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 500 or more employees, or for 50-499 employees if they make up at least 33% of the employer's active workforce. In determining whether a WARN Act notice is required, if the number of employees affected by a mass layoff is less than 50, and the layoff type is not a relocation or plant closure, Sterling Dynamics is not required to provide affected employees with a 60-day notice.

Acme Corp will pay overtime wages in compliance with California Labor Code Sections 510, 511, and 515. In addition, employees who work more than twelve (12) hours in a workday will be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond twelve (12) hours. Additionally, and with no exception, if a non-exempt employee works more than eight (8) hours on their seventh consecutive day in a workweek, they will be compensated at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for those hours worked over eight (8).\n\nFor clarity, the workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM through Saturday at 11:59 PM. Please also see Section 3.5, \"Meal and Rest Breaks,\" for additional information on legally required breaks, which do not count as time worked for overtime purposes. Overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor; unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action as detailed in Section 9.2 \"Employee Conduct.\" It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked, including overtime hours, on their timesheet. Failure to do so may result in delay of payment, or disciplinary action.

Acme Corp. complies with all applicable federal and state laws concerning meal and rest periods. This policy applies to all employees of Acme Corp.\n\n3.4.2 California Employees. Notwithstanding the provisions outlined in Section 3.4.1, employees whose primary work location is in the State of California are subject to the following provisions, which are intended to comply with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512.\n\n3.4.2.1 Meal Breaks. Pursuant to California law, all non-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, duty-free meal break. If a non-exempt employee works a shift longer than ten (10) hours, they shall be provided a second thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, duty-free meal break. Employees shall not be required to remain on the premises during their meal break, unless the nature of the work prevents the employee from being relieved of all duty, and the employee and Acme Corp. agree to an on-duty meal period in writing.\n\n3.4.2.2 Rest Breaks. Non-exempt employees working at least three and one-half (3.5) hours in a workday are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To clarify, a \"major fraction thereof\" is defined as any work period exceeding two (2) hours.\n\n3.4.2.3 Premium Pay. Should Acme Corp. fail to provide a required meal or rest break, or should an employee be required to work during a scheduled meal or rest break, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7.\n\n3.4.3 Employees Outside of California. For all employees located outside of California, Acme Corp. will abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding meal and rest periods. To the extent that federal law does not mandate meal or rest periods, Acme Corp. will comply with applicable state laws governing meal and rest breaks where legally obligated.\n\n3.4.4 Enforcement. All supervisors and managers are responsible for ensuring that employees are provided with the meal and rest breaks required by this policy and applicable law.

It applies to all active employees of Sterling Consolidated and its subsidiaries, including those in California, but excluding those subject to collective bargaining agreements that address break times (see Section 1.4, Collective Bargaining).\n\n**General Provisions:** Sterling Consolidated generally aims to comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding meal and rest breaks. However, the specific rules governing break times vary depending on the employee\u2019s location and employment classification. In cases where state and federal law differ, Sterling Consolidated will generally provide breaks in accordance with the stricter of the two, subject to exceptions as described below. Refer to Appendix A for a summary of applicable state break laws. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their break times in the timekeeping system.\n\n**California-Specific Provisions:** For employees working in California, the following provisions apply: Non-exempt employees are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break for every five (5) hours worked. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if the employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Employees are also entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked or major fraction thereof. If an employee is not provided a compliant meal or rest break as required under California law and the employee is terminated after working less than 12 months for the company, Sterling Consolidated may choose to not pay the employee any additional wages, subject to review by the HR department, as outlined in section 4.1 regarding involuntary termination procedures.\n\n**Federal Law:** Federal law does not require meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Sterling Consolidated provides breaks of short duration (generally, five (5) to twenty (20) minutes), these breaks must be paid. Meal breaks of thirty (30) minutes or longer are generally unpaid if the employee is completely relieved of all duties during the break period.\n\n**Policy Interpretation:** This policy is intended to be a general guideline. The HR department is responsible for interpreting and applying this policy in specific situations.

This policy outlines the company's procedures regarding workforce reductions that may trigger the requirements of the California WARN Act. This policy applies to all SparkleClean Inc. employees located in California.\n\nThe California WARN Act mandates that employers with 75 or more employees provide 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials before any \"mass layoff,\" \"plant closure,\" or \"relocation,\" as those terms are defined under the Act, affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. A mass layoff excludes terminations for cause, voluntary departures, or retirements. A plant closure occurs when an employment site is shut down, and 50 or more employees suffer an employment loss within a 30-day period. A relocation is the removal of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations of an employer to a different location 100 miles or more away.\n\nTherefore, if SparkleClean Inc. has at least 75 employees in California and plans a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period due to economic reasons, the company must provide 60 days advance written notice to the affected employees, the EDD, and the relevant local government officials.

Employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are eligible to receive partial wage replacement benefits (currently 60-70% of wages) for up to eight (8) weeks within a 12-month period to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). More information can be found on the EDD website at [fictitious website]. See Section 3.2.5 for return-to-work requirements post-PFL.\n*   **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** FMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. These reasons include the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job. To be eligible for FMLA leave at Sterling Dynamics Inc., an employee must have been employed by the company for at least twelve (12) months and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the leave.\n\nImportantly, any employee whose employment status is 'terminated', is not eligible to file or receive paid family leave.\n\n*   **Coordination of Leave:** Employees are encouraged to utilize both PFL and FMLA concurrently where applicable. The company will coordinate these leaves to provide employees with the maximum benefits available.

It is designed to comply with both California Labor Code and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This policy applies exclusively to employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. For questions regarding your exempt or non-exempt classification, please refer to Policy 3.1.2: Employee Classifications.\n\nSterling Dynamics generally expects employees to complete their assigned duties during their regularly scheduled work hours. However, situations may arise that necessitate overtime work. Non-exempt employees who are required or authorized to work overtime will be compensated as follows: Overtime compensation is calculated on a weekly basis, but with consideration given to daily work hours. In California, non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. However, this is subject to the following provision: for non-exempt employees working in California, and only when employee.hours_worked_weekly is less than or equal to 40 hours, if employee.hours_worked_daily exceeds eight (8) hours on any workday during the workweek, then those hours exceeding eight (8) on that specific workday will be compensated at the overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate of pay. Please note that the calculation yielding the greatest overtime compensation will be applied. All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor, as outlined in Section 3.2.4(a): Overtime Authorization. Failure to obtain pre-approval may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5 times regular rate for hours exceeding 8 in a day\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"for non-exempt employees working in California, and only when employee.hours_worked_weekly is less than or equal to 40 hours, if employee.hours_worked_daily exceeds eight (8) hours on any workday during the workweek, then those hours exceeding eight (8) on that specific workday will be compensated at the overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate of pay.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Sterling Dynamics Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "overtime", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

Because TechForward values its employees and adheres to all applicable labor laws, this policy explains when and how employees will be compensated for overtime work. This policy specifically applies to employees whose primary work location is in the State of California. (See Policy 1.1: Geographic Scope of Policies).\n\n**Overtime Pay**\n\nIn California, overtime is generally defined as any hours actually worked beyond eight (8) hours in a single workday or forty (40) hours in a single workweek, as described below. TechForward\u2019s standard workweek runs from Monday at 12:00 AM to Sunday at 11:59 PM. The rate of pay for overtime work is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For employees whose primary location is in California and who are classified as non-exempt, if an employee works more than eight hours in a workday or more than forty hours in a workweek, the employee is entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay. Employees who are classified as exempt are not eligible for overtime pay.

This section outlines our policy regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Employees working in California, who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI), are eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, which provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70%) for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. PFL runs concurrently with any applicable FMLA leave. To be eligible for PFL, the employee.sdi_contributor must be true.\n\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. At Evergreen Solutions, to be eligible for FMLA, employees must have been employed for at least 12 months (employee.tenure_months >= 12) and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the leave (employee.hours_worked_12_months >= 1250), and Evergreen Solutions must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite (employer.employee_count_within_75_miles >= 50). FMLA covers leave for the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. Because FMLA is unpaid, employees who qualify for both FMLA and California PFL will receive wage replacement through PFL for up to 8 weeks, while the remaining portion of their 12-week FMLA leave will be unpaid. If an employee is not eligible for California PFL because they do not contribute to SDI (employee.sdi_contributor is false), they may still be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, provided they meet the other eligibility requirements. All leave requests must be submitted to Human Resources at least 30 days in advance when the need for leave is foreseeable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"California Paid Family Leave benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement\": \"60-70%\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees working in California, who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI), are eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, which provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70%) for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 12,\n          \"pay_status\": \"unpaid\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"At Evergreen Solutions, to be eligible for FMLA, employees must have been employed for at least 12 months (employee.tenure_months >= 12) and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the leave (employee.hours_worked_12_months >= 1250), and Evergreen Solutions must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite (employer.employee_count_within_75_miles >= 50).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_pfl_overlap_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"PFL runs concurrently with FMLA leave.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"PFL runs concurrently with any applicable FMLA leave.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_no_pfl_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Unpaid FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 12\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee is not eligible for California PFL because they do not contribute to SDI (employee.sdi_contributor is false), they may still be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave, provided they meet the other eligibility requirements.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Paid Family Leave and FMLA Policy\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "restriction"}}

It's important to understand that overtime regulations can be complex and vary depending on where you work. This policy is intended to comply with both federal law (Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA) and applicable state laws, including those of California. Where state and federal laws differ, Acme Corp. will adhere to the law that is more beneficial to the employee.\n\nNon-exempt employees (as defined in Section 2.1 of this handbook) are eligible for overtime pay. Generally, federal law requires overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times your regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek.\n\nHowever, for employees working in California, the rules are somewhat different. In California, employees are entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, or over forty (40) in a workweek. Furthermore, in California, if an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a workday, they will be compensated at twice their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve. This also applies to all hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek for those working in California.\n\nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to accurately record all hours worked. Any discrepancies or questions about overtime pay should be immediately brought to the attention of your supervisor or the HR department. Note that pre-approval from your supervisor is required for all overtime hours. Failure to obtain pre-approval does not negate your right to overtime pay for hours actually worked, but may result in disciplinary action per Section 8.3. This policy does not create any contractual rights and may be modified at any time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_federal_001\",\n

Please note that this section applies only to employees whose primary work location is in California.\n\nUpon termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, final paychecks will be issued in accordance with California Labor Code Sections 201-202, except as noted below. Generally, an employee who is involuntarily terminated will receive their final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time (see Policy 5.1 for Vacation Accrual details), immediately upon termination. In instances where immediate payment is not feasible due to payroll processing constraints, the final paycheck will be available for pickup at the employee's usual work location no later than 72 hours after termination, excluding weekends and holidays. Employees will be notified of the exact time and location for paycheck pickup.\n\nFor employees who voluntarily resign, the timing of the final paycheck depends on the amount of notice provided. If an employee provides at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation, they will receive their final paycheck on their last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of employment. Despite the language above, the company may elect to pay a voluntarily terminated employee under the rules that apply to involuntary terminations at the discretion of the VP of Human Resources.\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to ensure that Sterling Innovations has their current mailing address to facilitate timely delivery of the final paycheck if direct deposit is not elected. Failure to provide an accurate address may result in delays in receiving the final paycheck."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"immediately upon termination\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Generally, an employee who is involuntarily terminated will receive their final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time (see Policy 5.1 for Vacation Accrual details), immediately upon termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination_exception\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck made available for pickup\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"no later than 72 hours after termination\",\n          \"pickup_location\": \"employee's usual work location\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In instances where immediate payment is not feasible due to payroll processing constraints, the final paycheck will be available for pickup at the employee's usual work location no later than 72 hours after termination, excluding weekends and holidays.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_voluntary_termination_with_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"on their last day of employment\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee provides at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation, they will receive their final paycheck on their last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_voluntary_termination_without_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck made available\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"within 72 hours of their last day of employment\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Sterling Innovations HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "final_paycheck", "rule_type": "termination"}}

PFL is managed by the California Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\nAn employee who is actively employed, whose primary work location is California, and who does *not* pay into the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) program due to their employment classification being exempt, will not be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. This means that the employee will not receive partial wage replacement from the EDD during their leave period. To determine if you pay into SDI, please review your paystub. You may, however, still be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) if all other FMLA eligibility requirements are met, as outlined in Section 3.7.2.\n\nEmployees are responsible for understanding the specific requirements and limitations of both PFL and FMLA.

However, where immediate payment is not feasible due to circumstances beyond the control of Global Dynamics Corp., such as payroll processing limitations, the final paycheck shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no case later than 72 hours following the termination.\n\nEmployees who voluntarily resign their employment must provide at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 advance notice of their intended resignation. Employees who provide such notice shall receive their final paycheck on their last day of employment. Employees who voluntarily resign without providing at least seventy-two (72) hours\u2019 advance notice shall receive their final paycheck within seventy-two (72) hours of their last day of employment. These requirements notwithstanding, salaried employees will have their final paycheck issued on the company's standard payroll date, provided that date is within 72 hours of their termination. This policy applies to California employees regardless of employment status, but is subservient to valid collective bargaining agreements. Global Dynamics Corp. reserves the right to pursue legal remedies for any damages incurred as a result of an employee's failure to provide adequate notice of resignation.

In accordance with California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515, non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime compensation for hours worked beyond eight (8) hours in any workday or forty (40) hours in any workweek. For purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM. All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s direct supervisor, or it may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, depending on the frequency of unapproved overtime hours worked.\n\n**3.4.2 Overtime Rates**\n\nPursuant to California law, overtime compensation shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday, or in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek, whichever calculation yields the greater overtime payment. Furthermore, employees shall be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an employee's primary function at Ardent Technologies involves technical expertise related to network maintenance, and the employee is non-exempt and under the age of 25, their eligibility for the double-time rate is subject to review and may be denied if the number of hours worked over 12 are deemed unreasonable given the circumstances. This decision is at the sole discretion of the HR Manager, under Policy 2.11 (Disciplinary Action Procedures). In such cases, the employee will instead receive 1.5 times their regular rate of pay.\n\n**3.4.3 Reporting Overtime Hours**\nAll overtime hours must be accurately recorded in the employee's timesheet

Acme Corp values its employees and strives to provide as much advance notice as possible in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. However, compliance can be complex, and this policy is intended only to provide guidance; consultation with Legal and HR is always required. This policy is applicable to all Acme Corp employees working within the state of California.\n\nA \"mass layoff\" under California law is defined as a reduction in force affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. It is Acme Corp's policy to provide at least 60 calendar days' written notice to affected employees before any mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that results in termination of employment for 50 or more California-based employees at a single site of employment within a 30-day period, where Acme Corp employs 75 or more employees. For the avoidance of doubt, this applies even if the federal WARN Act (which has a 100-employee trigger) does not apply, as long as we meet the California threshold of 75 or more employees.\n\nIf a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects 50 or more employees in California, then at least 60 days\u2019 notice is required.

This immediate payment requirement applies regardless of whether the employee is salaried or hourly and includes all wages earned up to and including the date of termination.

The Company recognizes its obligations to provide timely notice to affected employees, government agencies, and applicable labor organizations when such actions meet the thresholds defined by these laws.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nGenerally, and subject to applicable exceptions detailed below, if the Company anticipates a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation as defined under the WARN Acts, it will provide written notice at least sixty (60) calendar days in advance of the event. For the purposes of this policy, a \u201cmass layoff\u201d means a reduction in force that results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for (a) at least 50 employees, not counting any part-time employees, if the 50 employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment; or (b) 500 or more employees, regardless of the percentage of the employees at the single site of employment. A \"plant closure\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees.\n\nHowever, for employees located in California, this notification requirement extends to mass layoffs affecting 50 or more employees if the company employs 75 or more individuals in California, regardless of the percentage threshold defined above. If, on the other hand, the affected employee count is more than 50, but our total employee count company-wide is less than 100, the federal WARN act does not apply. Under those circumstances, the California employee's entitlement will vary depending on the site location.

As required by California law, Acme Corp. will pay one hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal period is not provided, and is not properly waived pursuant to the procedure outlined above. Refer to policy 3.2.3 for information about break tracking.\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks:** Non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid rest break of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of the work period, if practical. Please see Section 3.2.4 for rules concerning scheduling.\n\n**3.2.3 Break Tracking:** It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to accurately record all meal and rest breaks using the company\u2019s timekeeping system. Failure to record breaks properly may impact compliance with applicable wage and hour laws. See policy 5.1 concerning Timekeeping Procedures.\n\n**3.2.4 Break Scheduling:** Supervisors must make a good faith effort to schedule meal and rest breaks in accordance with this policy. Meal breaks should be scheduled no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth hour of work, and the second meal break, where applicable, no later than the end of the employee's tenth hour of work, except as specified in section 3.2.1."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n

TitanCorp is committed to complying with all applicable wage and hour laws. However, to ensure consistency and administrative ease, the timing of final paycheck distribution may vary based on the circumstances of the employee\u2019s separation from the company.\n\nGenerally, in accordance with California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, an employee who is involuntarily terminated will receive their final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time, immediately upon termination. This paycheck will be provided at the time of termination or mailed to the employee\u2019s last known address if immediate in-person delivery is not feasible.\n\nFor employees who voluntarily resign, the timing depends on advance notice. If an employee provides at least 72 hours\u2019 notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. However, if an employee quits without providing at least 72 hours\u2019 advance notice, the final paycheck, inclusive of accrued vacation as detailed in Section 4.5 (Vacation Accrual and Use), will be made available no later than 72 hours following their last day of work.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, and to facilitate timely processing, for all employees with less than six (6) months tenure who separate employment during the first week of a pay period, TitanCorp reserves the right to disburse final pay on the next regularly scheduled payday. This exception does not apply to instances of involuntary termination, and the employee will be notified of the reason for delayed disbursement. Additionally, the payroll department retains the right to make alternative arrangements for paycheck delivery, ensuring the payment of all wages due within the legally mandated timeframe. The Payroll Manager can approve exceptions in documented hardship cases on a case-by-case basis. Any questions regarding final paycheck disbursement should be directed to the HR department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck disbursement immediately upon termination, including accrued vacation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Generally, in accordance with California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, an employee who is involuntarily terminated will receive their final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time, immediately upon termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_voluntary_72_hour_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck disbursement on the last day of employment, including accrued vacation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee provides at least 72 hours\\u2019 notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_voluntary_less_than_72_hour_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck disbursement no later than 72 hours following the last day of work, including accrued vacation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if an employee quits without providing at least 72 hours\\u2019 advance notice, the final paycheck, inclusive of accrued vacation as detailed in Section 4.5 (Vacation Accrual and Use), will be made available no later than 72 hours following their last day of work.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_exception_short_tenure\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"terminated\",\n            \"resigned\",\n            \"laid_off\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final pay disbursement on the next regularly scheduled payday\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the above, and to facilitate timely processing, for all employees with less than six (6) months tenure who separate employment during the first week of a pay period, TitanCorp reserves the right to disburse final pay on the next regularly scheduled payday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"TitanCorp HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "final_paycheck", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, but which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees if those 50 employees make up at least 33% of the employer\u2019s active workforce at that site, or at least 500 employees, regardless of the percentage of the workforce. For the purposes of this policy, an employee shall only be covered by the WARN Act protection if the employer has 100 or more employees. Advance notice of at least 60 calendar days will be provided before any plant closing or mass layoff that meets the above criteria. Acme Corp is not required to provide WARN Act notice if the total number of affected employees at a single site of employment is less than 50.

This policy is designed to comply with California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, which have stricter requirements than federal law.\n\n**3.12.1 Timing of Final Paycheck**\n\nThe timing of your final paycheck depends on whether your termination was voluntary or involuntary. Please note that this policy ONLY applies to employees whose work location is in California, as indicated by their primary work address in our HR system.\n\n**(a) Involuntary Termination:** If SparkleClean terminates your employment (e.g., layoff, termination for cause), your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, must be available to you immediately upon termination. This means your check will be ready for pickup at your usual worksite at the time of termination. If your final paycheck is not immediately available at the time of termination, you are required to notify HR immediately for assistance.\n\n**(b) Voluntary Resignation with 72 Hours\u2019 Notice:** If you resign from SparkleClean and provide at least 72 hours\u2019 advance notice of your resignation date, your final paycheck will be available to you on your last day of employment.

This section outlines our policies regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. To be eligible for FMLA, employees must have worked for Acme Corp. for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Also, Acme Corp. must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Reasons for FMLA leave include the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee\u2019s job. See Section 4.2.7 for detailed FMLA eligibility guidelines.\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible employees who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner) or to bond with a new child. To be eligible for California PFL, employees must contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI). California PFL runs concurrently with FMLA leave when the leave qualifies for both.\n\nHowever, employees who work in California and do not contribute to SDI are not eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL), even if they meet all other FMLA requirements, and need to care for a qualifying family member.

This policy outlines the company\u2019s obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, a federal law designed to protect workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide notification of plant closings and mass layoffs.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirement**\n\nIn compliance with the federal WARN Act, Sunrise Technologies will provide written notice at least 60 calendar days in advance of any plant closing or mass layoff that meets the following criteria:\n\n*   **Plant Closing:** The permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n*   **Mass Layoff:** A reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 500 or more employees, or 50-499 employees if they make up at least 33% of the employer\u2019s active workforce at that site.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, an \u201cemployment loss\u201d means a termination of employment, other than a discharge for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement; a layoff exceeding 6 months; or a reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during each month of any 6-month period.\n\nIf Sunrise Technologies employs 100 or more employees company-wide, and a layoff is anticipated affecting 500 or more employees, a WARN notice is required to be issued to affected employees, the State Rapid Response Team and local government officials.

If you have any questions regarding your overtime eligibility or the calculation of your overtime pay, please contact the Payroll Department for clarification.

These requirements are mandated by California state law, which provides greater protections than federal law in this area. This policy applies only to employees physically working in California. Employees working outside of California should refer to the employee handbook supplement applicable to their work location. This policy is intended to ensure compliance with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512.\n\nAll non-exempt Sterling Consolidated employees in California are entitled to meal and rest breaks as follows:\n\n*   **Meal Breaks:** Employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This meal break should ideally be scheduled near the middle of the shift. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record their break times. Sterling Consolidated will not permit employees to work through their meal periods.\n\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should ideally be scheduled near the middle of each four-hour work period. To be clear, if an employee works at least 3.5 hours, then a 10 minute break is required. Rest breaks are considered \"on-duty\" breaks, meaning employees must remain available to perform their duties if needed.\n\nSterling Consolidated understands that from time to time employees may miss meal or rest breaks due to legitimate business needs.

In all circumstances, the final paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including accrued vacation time where applicable pursuant to Section 4.1 of this policy.\n\n4.  2.  2 California Employees: Notwithstanding Section 3.2.1, for employees whose primary work location is within the State of California, the following provisions shall apply pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202. If an employee is involuntarily terminated, the final paycheck shall be provided to the employee immediately upon termination. If an employee resigns and provides at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation, the final paycheck shall be provided to the employee on their last day of employment. If an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours advance notice, the final paycheck shall be available for the employee within 72 hours of their resignation.

Effective Date:** January 1, 2024. **Revision:** 1.0\n\nThis policy outlines Acme Corp.'s overtime compensation practices for non-exempt employees working in California, in compliance with applicable California and federal law. Please note that this policy applies exclusively to employees physically working within the state of California.\n\n**3.2.2. Overtime Eligibility and Calculation**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. For such employees, overtime compensation will be paid in accordance with California law. An employee will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, or for the first eight hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. Should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they will be compensated at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12).\n\nFurther, non-exempt employees shall also be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. Note that hours paid at the daily overtime rate (1.5x for hours exceeding 8 in a day) will count towards the 40 hour workweek threshold.\n\nFor purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM. Any exceptions to this overtime policy, including those due to special project needs, require prior written approval from the employee\u2019s direct supervisor and the HR department. Employees over the age of 18 are subject to all overtime rules unless otherwise exempted per federal and state law. If an employee's classification changes to exempt, overtime is no longer applicable starting with the effective date of the change.

Employees are responsible for understanding and adhering to the break policies applicable to their work location.\n\nFor employees working in California, the following rules apply: If an employee works more than five (5) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. A second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Employees are required to take their meal breaks no later than the end of their fifth (5th) hour of work, or sixth (6th) hour with a valid waiver, as described in Section 3.2.a.\n\nIn addition to meal breaks, employees working in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, to the extent feasible, be taken in the middle of each work period. If an employee does not receive their legally mandated meal or rest break, they are entitled to one (1) hour of pay at their regular rate for each missed break. Please note, these California-specific rules supersede any conflicting general guidance in Section 3.0 pertaining to employee breaks. For employees working outside of California, Sterling Consolidated will provide breaks in accordance with applicable federal and state law. Employees are expected to return to their work duties immediately upon the conclusion of any meal or rest period.

A \"plant closure\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding any part-time employees.\n\nFor locations in California, because the California WARN Act may have lower thresholds, GlobalCorp will provide written notice to affected employees and the California Employment Development Department (EDD) at least 60 days in advance if a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects 50 or more employees, and GlobalCorp\u2019s total employment is 75 or more employees at the location or worksite. All other US locations will follow the federal WARN Act where 100 or more employees triggers the 60 day notice period. While GlobalCorp strives to provide as much notice as possible, this is ultimately contingent upon business needs and operational constraints, and it should be noted that in all instances, whether or not the company opts to offer severance, such severance does not supplant or constitute meeting the requirements of 60-day notice period. This notice requirement applies only to involuntary terminations due to a qualifying event.

Such PFL benefits provide partial wage replacement, currently at a rate of sixty (60) to seventy (70) percent of the employee\u2019s usual weekly wage, up to a statutory maximum, for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks within any twelve (12) month period.\n\n5.  3.2. **FMLA Leave**: Eligible employees, as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq., working for Sterling Consolidated, Inc. at worksites where fifty (50) or more employees are employed by the company within seventy-five (75) miles of that worksite, and who have been employed by Sterling Consolidated, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked at least 1,250 hours for the company during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, are eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including but not limited to, the birth of a child, the adoption of a child, or to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition.\n\n6.  3.3. **Integration of PFL and FMLA**: For California employees eligible for both California PFL and federal FMLA leave for the same qualifying event (e.g., bonding with a newborn child), Sterling Consolidated, Inc. will administer these leaves concurrently. The employee shall initially utilize their PFL benefits, and the period of PFL leave will run concurrently with the employee's FMLA leave. However, the total combined leave period shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks.\n\n7.  3.4 **Notification Requirements**: Employees seeking to utilize either PFL or FMLA shall notify the HR department at least thirty (30) days in advance of the anticipated leave commencement date, if the need for leave is foreseeable.

This section outlines the company's policy regarding meal and rest breaks. As a general principle, Sterling Consolidated strives to comply with all applicable federal regulations regarding employee breaks.\n\nAll non-exempt employees are eligible for breaks, although the specific timing and duration of such breaks may vary depending on operational needs and departmental schedules. Specifically, should a non-exempt employee work at least eight (8) hours during a single workday, they are generally expected to take at least a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Such meal breaks should ideally be scheduled near the midpoint of the shift, but supervisors retain discretion in determining the precise timing, taking into account workload and coverage requirements. Rest breaks, typically of shorter duration, may be provided at the supervisor's discretion, considering factors such as employee fatigue, the nature of the work being performed, and applicable safety regulations. While Sterling Consolidated endeavors to offer convenient break opportunities, the failure to take a break does not create any separate or additional rights or remedies for employees, provided management makes a reasonable effort to provide the opportunity. Note that nothing in this policy shall be interpreted to contravene applicable regulations, as per Section 1.2, \"Interpretation of Policy\". As a reminder, Sterling Consolidated employees must accurately record all time worked, including break periods, as outlined in Section 3.1, \"Timekeeping Procedures\".\n\nSupervisors are responsible for ensuring adequate coverage during break periods and for addressing any questions or concerns employees may have regarding this policy. Employees are encouraged to communicate with their supervisors if they have difficulty taking scheduled breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eight_hours_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee must take at least a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, should a non-exempt employee work at least eight (8) hours during a single workday, they are generally expected to take at least a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Sterling Consolidated HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2025-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "restriction"}}

Acme Corp is committed to treating all employees with respect and dignity during these transitions. This policy is intended to comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq. Note that this policy applies to all US employees, irrespective of their state of residence.\n\nAcme Corp will provide advance notice of any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined under the WARN Act, to affected employees. A \"plant closing\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, where these employees represent at least 33% of the employer's total active workforce at that single site of employment.

This section outlines the company's policy on overtime pay, which is designed to follow both federal and California state regulations. Given the complexities of these regulations, employees should consult with their supervisor or the HR department if they have any questions regarding their eligibility for overtime or the calculation of overtime pay.\n\nNon-exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), are generally eligible for overtime pay. Overtime is defined as time worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. For employees working in California, overtime is also earned for time worked over eight hours in a workday. In accordance with California law, employees will receive one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond eight (8) in a single workday, up to twelve (12) hours, and for all hours worked beyond forty (40) in a workweek, if the weekly hours exceed the daily calculation. Furthermore, for California employees, two times the regular rate of pay will be paid for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday or for any hours worked beyond eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.\n\nIt is important to note that this policy is subject to change and does not create any contractual rights. The company reserves the right to modify or terminate this policy at any time, with or without notice. Some employees might be classified as exempt and are therefore not eligible for overtime, as outlined in section 3.3 of this handbook, \"Exempt Employee Classifications\". Questions regarding exempt status should be directed to the HR department. The calculation of overtime will be based on the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay, as defined by applicable law, and will include all non-discretionary bonuses and commissions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_weekly_flsa_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), are generally eligible for overtime pay.

A second 30-minute unpaid meal break shall be provided for work periods exceeding ten (10) hours. These meal breaks must commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work and tenth (10th) hour of work respectively. Furthermore, non-exempt employees working in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Employees are required to take all meal and rest breaks as required by law. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.\n\n**3.4.2 Employees Outside of California:** For employees located outside of California, Innovision Corp. will adhere to applicable federal law. Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Innovision Corp. chooses to provide short breaks (typically lasting five (5) to twenty (20) minutes), these breaks shall be considered paid time. Bona fide meal periods (typically thirty (30) minutes or more) need not be compensated when the employee is completely relieved of duty for the purpose of eating a regular meal.\n\n**3.4.3 Missed Breaks:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, in California, if a meal or rest break is not provided in accordance with Section 3.4.1, the employee shall be compensated with one (1) hour of premium pay for each missed meal or rest break.

Sterling Dynamics strives to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, though certain provisions will vary depending on employee location and classification.\n\n**General Provisions:**\n\nSterling Dynamics acknowledges the importance of providing employees with adequate breaks during their workdays. This policy is intended to comply with both California state law and applicable federal regulations concerning meal and rest breaks. Employees are responsible for adhering to this policy.\n\n**California Employees:**\n\nFor employees working in California, the following provisions apply:\n\n*   Any employee working more than five (5) hours in a workday is entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal period.\n*   A second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal period is required for any employee working more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Such second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and employee only if the total hours worked in the workday do not exceed twelve (12) hours, and the first meal period was not waived.\n*   Employees shall receive a paid ten (10)-minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\n*   If Sterling Dynamics does not provide a required meal or rest period, the employee will be compensated with one (1) hour of pay at their regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided.\n\n**Employees Outside of California:**\n\nFor employees working in states other than California, Sterling Dynamics will comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding meal and rest breaks. It is Sterling Dynamics' policy to provide employees with appropriate break times, generally in accordance with federal guidelines.

This policy outlines our procedures for providing advance notice of layoffs, in compliance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the California WARN Act.\n\n**3.2.1 General Notice Requirement:**\n\nAcme Corp. will provide employees with written notice at least 60 days before any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined by the WARN Acts. A \"plant closing\" means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for (a) 50 or more employees when the employer employs at least 100 employees excluding any part-time employees; or (b) 50 or more employees when the employer employs fewer than 100 employees, but at least 75 employees excluding any part-time employees.\n\nIf Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees company-wide and plans a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site, we are required to provide 60 days' notice under the Federal WARN Act. However, if those affected employees are in California, the threshold drops to 75 total employees company-wide including those in California, and the layoff affects 50 or more, then the CA WARN act will govern. Further details on employee separation policies can be found in Section 3.3.\n\n**3.2.2 Exemptions and Exceptions:**\n\nWhile we aim to provide 60 days' notice whenever possible, unforeseen business circumstances may necessitate shorter notice periods. In such cases, we will provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable. We will also make every effort to provide affected employees with resources and support to assist them in their job search."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_federal\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees_affected_by_layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees company-wide and plans a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site, we are required to provide 60 days' notice under the Federal WARN Act.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees_affected_by_layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if those affected employees are in California, the threshold drops to 75 total employees company-wide including those in California, and the layoff affects 50 or more, then the CA WARN act will govern.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

The federal WARN Act requires 60 days advance written notice if a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, provided the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. Please note that temporary employees, as defined in Section 1.4, and employees on approved leaves of absence, as defined in Section 4.1, may or may not be counted towards the 50-employee threshold depending on the specific circumstances and the guidance provided by legal counsel at the time of the event.\n\nIn California, the state WARN Act has slightly different requirements. If Sterling Fabricators Inc. employs 75 or more employees, the California WARN Act may be triggered if a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. In determining whether an event triggers the California WARN Act, all employees working in California are counted toward the 75-employee threshold. The HR department, in coordination with legal counsel, will be responsible for evaluating each situation to determine whether notification is required under either the federal or California WARN Act, or both.

Employees working in California are eligible for leave benefits as outlined herein, which shall be interpreted in accordance with California law.\n\n3.12.2 **Eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** Pursuant to California Unemployment Insurance Code Sections 3300 et seq., employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) are eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of PFL benefits within a twelve (12) month period for qualifying events, including bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. The employee's employment status must be active at the commencement of the leave. Employees whose employment status is terminated, resigned, or laid off prior to the commencement of the leave period are not eligible for PFL benefits through The Golden Gate Corporation, notwithstanding their prior SDI contributions. Eligibility for continued PFL benefits following a valid leave that was started prior to a change in employment status will be determined by the Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\n3.12.3 **Interaction with FMLA:** While the federal FMLA provides for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave, employees are eligible for unpaid leave under FMLA only if Golden Gate Corporation employs fifty (50) or more employees within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of the employee's worksite, and the employee has worked for the company for at least twelve (12) months and at least 1,250 hours in the preceding twelve (12) months. The employee\u2019s leave type must also qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act, such as being for a medical condition, or to bond with a child.\n\n3.12.4 **Leave Termination:** Should an employee, who is receiving PFL benefits, voluntarily resign their position with The Golden Gate Corporation or be involuntarily terminated for cause, the employee\u2019s participation in PFL will not be affected. The employee must notify the Employment Development Department of their termination if it occurs during their leave.

This section outlines our policy regarding overtime compensation, which is designed to comply with both federal and California state law. Note: this policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.\n\n**3.2.1 Overtime Eligibility & Calculation**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. \u201cNon-exempt\u201d refers to employees who are covered by federal and state wage and hour laws and therefore entitled to overtime compensation. Overtime pay will be calculated based on an employee\u2019s regular hourly rate of pay. According to federal law and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), overtime is earned when an employee works more than forty (40) hours in a workweek. However, employees located in California are also entitled to overtime compensation for any hours worked over eight (8) in a single workday. Therefore, if a non-exempt employee in California works more than eight (8) hours in a workday but does *not* exceed forty (40) hours in the workweek, they will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours exceeding eight (8) worked that day. Employees cannot waive their right to overtime pay. If the employee works over 40 hours in a week, even if they have daily overtime, they are entitled to 1.5x their wage for any hours worked over 40, regardless of previous daily calculations. This policy is intended to be interpreted in accordance with all applicable federal and California wage and hour laws, including, but not limited to, California Labor Code Sections 500 et seq.

This policy applies exclusively to employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. Notwithstanding any other provision in this handbook, the following meal and rest break requirements shall govern for all non-exempt employees.\n\n3.4.2 Meal Breaks\n\nPursuant to California Labor Code Section 512, all non-exempt employees of Titan Industries who work more than five (5) hours in a workday shall be provided with a meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes. The meal period must commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work, except where a waiver is mutually agreed upon as outlined in section 3.4.4. If a non-exempt employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they shall be provided with a second meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes, which must commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work, unless an applicable waiver is in place. These meal periods are unpaid, provided that the employee is completely relieved of all duty and responsibility during the meal period.\n\n3.4.3 Rest Breaks\n\nAll non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To the extent feasible, rest breaks should be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period. Rest breaks shall not be taken at the beginning or end of the workday.\n\n3.4.4 Meal Period Waivers\n\nWhere a workday of not more than six (6) hours will complete the day's work, the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employer and the employee. Additionally, if an employee works more than ten (10) hours per workday, the second meal period may be waived if the employee and the employer consent, provided that the first meal period was not waived. Such waivers must be documented in writing and signed by both the employee and a representative of Titan Industries Human Resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_break_entitlement\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"30-minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 512, all non-exempt employees of Titan Industries who work more than five (5) hours in a workday shall be provided with a meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_second_meal_break_entitlement\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"second 30-minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a non-exempt employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they shall be provided with a second meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes, which must commence no later than the end of the employee\\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work, unless an applicable waiver is in place.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_rest_break_entitlement\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"All non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_break_waiver\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"waiver of first meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Where a workday of not more than six (6) hours will complete the day's work, the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employer and the employee.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Titan Industries Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

All other employees outside of California will receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination date.

This policy outlines the break requirements applicable to employees of Stellaris Technologies, Inc. within the United States, pursuant to applicable federal law. Notwithstanding any other Stellaris Technologies, Inc. policy, including but not limited to Section 2.1 regarding employee scheduling, the following shall apply. Because Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for employees aged eighteen (18) or over, Stellaris Technologies, Inc. is not required to provide such breaks. However, where Stellaris Technologies, Inc. voluntarily provides breaks of a short duration, specifically five (5) minutes to twenty (20) minutes in length, such breaks shall be considered \"rest periods\" and shall be compensated as time worked. Conversely, meal periods, defined as periods of thirty (30) minutes or more during which the employee is completely relieved of all duties, are not required to be compensated, provided the employee is, in fact, completely relieved of all duties. Determination of complete relief shall be made at the sole discretion of the employee's supervisor or manager, and the employee bears the responsibility of bringing any concerns about non-compliant break periods to the attention of Human Resources within five (5) business days of the alleged infraction. Moreover, failure to comply with these federal standards concerning paid rest periods can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Should any portion of an authorized meal period require an employee to conduct work duties, that said meal period is considered a rest period under federal standards. Employees must report any time worked to their supervisor for accurate record keeping.\n\nFurthermore, while Stellaris Technologies, Inc. endeavors to provide a work environment that complies with all applicable laws, employees are solely responsible for tracking their time and ensuring the accuracy of their timecards.

As far as possible, rest breaks should be scheduled in the middle of the four-hour work period. An employee's failure to take a break is not a violation of the policy so long as it is not the result of the company preventing it.\n\nAny employee who feels they were prevented from taking their meal or rest breaks should immediately notify their manager, and may be subject to termination as stated in Section 5.1 (disciplinary actions)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"prevent_breaks_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employee to notify manager if prevented from taking breaks\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Any employee who feels they were prevented from taking their meal or rest breaks should immediately notify their manager, and may be subject to termination as stated in Section 5.1 (disciplinary actions).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "termination"}}

Starlight Technologies is committed to complying with both state and federal regulations regarding employee leave.\n\n*   **Overview:** California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides eligible employees with partial wage replacement benefits while they take time off to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying event related to a family member's military deployment. FMLA provides eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected leave for similar reasons, as well as for their own serious health condition. These two leaves may run concurrently or consecutively, depending on the employee\u2019s eligibility for each and the specific circumstances of the leave request.\n\n*   **California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** Under California law, eligible employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may receive up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits (typically 60-70% of their usual wages) through the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD) while taking time off for qualifying family care or bonding purposes. This leave is administered by the EDD, not Starlight Technologies directly. Please consult the EDD website for complete information on eligibility requirements and benefit amounts. If an employee works in California, contributes to SDI, requests leave for bonding with a new child, and the leave duration is eight weeks or less, then Starlight Technologies will cooperate with the EDD to facilitate that employee's claim for PFL benefits. Employees must file a claim with the EDD to receive PFL benefits.\n\n*   **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** FMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a twelve-month period for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked for Starlight Technologies for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the leave. Starlight Technologies adheres to the FMLA regulations for employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite.\n\n*   **Coordination of PFL and FMLA:** Where an employee is eligible for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves may run concurrently.

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave, complying with both federal and California law. Please note that eligibility requirements and benefit levels differ between the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL). Employees should consult with HR for individual clarification.\n\nEligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally entitled to participate in the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program. PFL provides partial wage replacement, typically between 60% and 70% of your usual wages, for up to 8 weeks to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. This leave runs concurrently with any FMLA leave. For clarification, eligibility for PFL is determined by the State of California, not Acme Corp. Employees may also be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) if the employee has worked for Acme Corp. for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave.\n\nWhile FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, the amount of leave an employee is actually entitled to may be affected by any previous FMLA leave that has been used by the employee in the past 12 months. For employees who qualify for both FMLA and PFL, the leave will run concurrently. Note that FMLA is generally unpaid, with the exception of using accrued PTO or vacation time to offset some of the absence; while PFL is paid by the state and will not require using existing vacation time. Therefore, up to 8 weeks could be compensated by the state under PFL while the remaining 4 weeks of FMLA leave may be unpaid. It is imperative that employees review their specific circumstances with the HR department to confirm the exact amount of leave they can take and payment options."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Partial wage replacement for up to 8 weeks through CA PFL.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement_percentage\": \"60-70\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Eligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally entitled to participate in the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program.

This policy outlines our guidelines for meal and rest breaks for all U.S.-based employees, consistent with federal labor laws. As a company operating nationwide, Innovatech Solutions strives to comply with all applicable laws and regulations; however, this policy describes the federal requirements only and is not intended to address state-specific requirements. Should an employee believe their state laws differ from the federal requirements outlined here, they should refer to state law and notify HR for further review.\n\nSubject to the conditions outlined in Section 3.7.2, employees will be provided with break periods according to the following standards. Non-exempt employees who are scheduled to work eight (8) or more hours in a workday are eligible for an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes. This meal period is to be scheduled approximately midway through their shift, provided that operational needs allow. Employees who work less than eight (8) hours may be afforded the opportunity to take a meal break at the discretion of their supervisor and based on workload demands, as per Section 3.7.1. The decision to provide a meal break in such circumstances, however, remains at the sole discretion of management. Because federal law does not mandate rest breaks for adult employees, Innovatech Solutions is not required to provide them. However, Innovatech may offer brief, paid rest periods during the workday. Such breaks are generally 10-15 minutes in duration and should not disrupt workflow. As explained in greater detail in Section 3.7.3, any such breaks granted by Innovatech will be considered time worked and included in the computation of wages. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all time worked, including any such paid breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30,\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt employees who are scheduled to work eight (8) or more hours in a workday are eligible for an unpaid meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Meal and Rest Breaks\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "compensation"}}

This policy outlines our commitment to providing eligible employees with job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**4.7.1 Eligibility for FMLA Leave**\n\nTo be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Skybound Industries for at least 12 months (which we calculate as 365 calendar days) and must have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the start of the leave. The 12 months of employment do not need to be consecutive. An employee is also eligible if their current employment status is active and are not employed in any state that offers its own paid family leave program that would otherwise cover the conditions under the current FMLA guidelines, in which case the employee's claim is deferred to the respective state's program. Furthermore, the employee must work at a location where Skybound Industries employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius, consistent with federal guidelines. Any employee not meeting all such conditions that are currently active and working will have their employment terminated immediately and will be classified as involuntary termination. This will not affect any unpaid salary earned prior to the termination.\n\n**4.7.2 Qualifying Reasons for FMLA Leave**\n\nEligible employees may take FMLA leave for any of the following reasons:\n\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n**4.7.3 Leave Duration and Compensation**\n\nFMLA leave provides up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave in a 12-month period. While the leave itself is unpaid, employees may be eligible to use accrued paid time off (PTO) or vacation time to receive compensation during the leave period, subject to company policy on PTO usage.\n\n**4.7.4 Employee Responsibilities**\n\nEmployees requesting FMLA leave must provide Skybound Industries with at least 30 days' advance notice when the need for leave is foreseeable. If 30 days' notice is not practicable, such as in the case of a medical emergency, employees must provide notice as soon as possible."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"terminate_fmla_ineligible\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"CA\",\n            \"NY\",\n            \"MA\",\n            \"NJ\",\n            \"CT\",\n            \"RI\",\n            \"WA\",\n            \"OR\",\n            \"CO\",\n            \"MD\",\n            \"DE\",\n            \"DC\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employee's employment will be terminated involuntarily\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"termination.type\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Any employee not meeting all such conditions that are currently active and working will have their employment terminated immediately and will be classified as involuntary termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Skybound Industries Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "termination"}}

It is the policy of Acme Corp. to ensure the timely and accurate disbursement of final wages to all employees upon separation from employment, in accordance with applicable federal law. Notwithstanding any state or local regulations to the contrary, this policy adheres to the standards set forth under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). All final wage payments shall be subject to applicable federal tax withholdings and deductions as mandated by law.\n\n3.12.2. **Timing of Final Payment**. Upon termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, Acme Corp. shall issue a final paycheck to the employee no later than the next regularly scheduled payday following the date of termination. This provision applies to all employees regardless of their employment status, classification, or tenure with the company. For the avoidance of doubt, the \"date of termination\" is defined as the last day the employee physically performs work for Acme Corp.\n\n3.12.3. **Method of Payment**. Final paychecks will be disbursed using the employee's chosen method of payment during their active employment, as outlined in Section 3.05 (Wage Payment Methods). Should the employee\u2019s direct deposit information be invalid or the employee otherwise requests a physical check, a physical check will be mailed to the employee's last known address as on file with Acme Corp.

This policy outlines the guidelines for overtime compensation for non-exempt employees. Overtime pay is earned when a non-exempt employee works more than a certain number of hours in a workday or workweek. For purposes of this policy, the workweek is defined as Sunday through Saturday.\n\nEmployees classified as non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws are eligible for overtime pay. Generally, overtime compensation is paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. However, employees working in California have different rules. Specifically, if an employee in California works over eight (8) hours in a workday, they will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for those hours, regardless of their total hours worked in that workweek. Also in California, if an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a workday, the pay rate changes to two times the regular rate of pay for hours exceeding twelve. Additionally, in California, for any employee who works more than eight (8) hours on their seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, those hours will be compensated at twice (2x) the employee's regular rate. Overtime must be approved in advance by the employee's supervisor, except in extraordinary situations. Please consult the payroll department or HR with any questions.\n\nEmployees should accurately record all hours worked on their timesheets. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.

Because Acme Corp. operates in multiple states, our policy must consider both federal and state laws. Where state law provides greater protection to employees than federal law, Acme Corp. will follow the more protective state law. This policy applies to all active employees except where superseded by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nFor employees working in California, if your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are eligible for a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, unpaid meal break. A second meal break of thirty (30) minutes is required if you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday. However, the second meal break may be waived by the employee if the total hours worked in the workday are no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal break was taken. You are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To clarify, a \"major fraction thereof\" means more than two hours. So, if an employee works 6 hours and 1 minute, they are entitled to two rest breaks.\n\nFor employees who are non-exempt and perform work outside of California, while federal law doesn't mandate meal or rest breaks, Acme Corp. provides employees a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break if the workday exceeds six (6) hours, or as otherwise required by applicable state law. All provided breaks between five (5) and twenty (20) minutes must be paid time.\n\nFailure to provide required meal and rest breaks can result in penalties. Employees should contact their supervisor immediately if they are unable to take their required breaks. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring employees are afforded all legally mandated breaks. If a break can not be provided for any reason, the employee must notify HR within 24 hours.

Sunrise Technologies is committed to treating all employees with respect and dignity during any workforce reduction event.\n\n**WARN Act Notification Requirements:**\n\nSunrise Technologies is subject to both the federal and California WARN Acts, which require advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials in the event of a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation. The stricter of the two laws will be followed.\n\n*   **California WARN Act Thresholds:** Sunrise Technologies will provide 60 calendar days advance written notice if a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation occurs that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period and Sunrise Technologies employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons in California. This employee count includes full-time, part-time, and commissioned employees.\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act Thresholds:** Regardless of the California WARN Act's applicability, if Sunrise Technologies employs 100 or more employees (including full-time and part-time) and a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day notice will also be required, regardless of employee location state.\n\n*   **Exclusions:** Independent contractors and consultants who are not considered employees under applicable state and federal law are not counted towards these thresholds. Employees who are offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are also excluded, provided the employee accepts the transfer.\n\n*   **Notification Procedures:** In the event that a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation triggers the notification requirements under either the federal or California WARN Act, Sunrise Technologies will adhere to all applicable notification requirements, including providing written notice to affected employees, the California EDD, and local government officials. This notice will contain all information required by the WARN Act, including the date of the planned action, the reasons for the action, and contact information for company representatives.\n\nRefer to Policy 2.15 - Termination of Employment, for further details on separation procedures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_75_employee_threshold\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 calendar days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Sunrise Technologies will provide 60 calendar days advance written notice if a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation occurs that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period and Sunrise Technologies employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons in California.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_federal_100_employee_threshold\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60-day notice will also be required\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Regardless of the California WARN Act's applicability, if Sunrise Technologies employs 100 or more employees (including full-time and part-time) and a plant closing or mass layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day notice will also be required, regardless of employee location state.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_exclusion_independent_contractors\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"independent_contractor\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"independent contractors and consultants are counted towards employee threshold under WARN Act\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Independent contractors and consultants who are not considered employees under applicable state and federal law are not counted towards these thresholds.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_exclusion_transfer\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"mass_layoff\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employees offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are counted toward thresholds under WARN act.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who are offered a transfer to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance and with no more than a six-month break in employment are also excluded, provided the employee accepts the transfer.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reductions and WARN Act Compliance (California)\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

This means that all final paychecks will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's last day of work. This is applicable to all employees across the United States, and adheres to federal standards. The final paycheck will include all wages earned through the employee's last day of work, including any accrued but unused vacation time as detailed in Section 4.5 Vacation Policy of this manual. Should an employee feel there is a discrepancy between wages earned and the final paycheck amount, they should contact the HR department directly at hr@acmecorp.com within 5 business days to submit a formal dispute.

This section outlines our policy regarding overtime compensation. Overtime pay is required for all non-exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Please note that specific overtime regulations may vary depending on your work location, particularly for employees working in California.\n\nFor employees working *outside* of California, overtime will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. This is in accordance with the FLSA. However, for employees whose primary work location is in California, the rules are slightly different. In California, overtime is paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday or forty (40) in a workweek. Furthermore, in California, employees are entitled to double their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a single workday. If an employee works seven consecutive days in a workweek in California, they will also receive double their regular rate of pay for any hours worked over eight (8) on that seventh day, *provided* that the employee is considered an active employee at the time the overtime is accrued. For the purposes of this policy, \"active employee\" means that the employee has not resigned or been terminated from their position. Any questions regarding overtime eligibility or pay calculations should be directed to the Human Resources Department, referencing Section 1.4 of this handbook which describes the procedure for submitting inquiries. Please be aware that the exact method of calculating overtime may be modified from time to time to comply with changes in state and federal law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\":

Compensation and Benefits**\n**Policy 3.2: Overtime Compensation**\n**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01\n**Revision:** 2.0\n\nIt is the policy of XYZ Corp. to compensate eligible employees for overtime hours worked, consistent with federal law. Overtime-eligible employees, defined as those classified as non-exempt per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), will receive overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek. For the purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM.\n\nSpecifically, an employee\u2019s time is compensable if it meets the requirements for hours worked under section 778 of the FLSA, regardless of how performance goals are reached or the employee's physical location or work schedule. However, this policy regarding overtime compensation applies exclusively to non-exempt employees, meaning any employee who is not explicitly designated as exempt is eligible for overtime. If an employee believes that they should be classified as exempt and are working over forty hours, they should refer to policy 3.1, Exempt Employee Classifications, before pursuing overtime pay. Payment will be made on the regular payday for the pay period in which the overtime was worked.\n\nIt is XYZ Corp.\u2019s policy to comply with any applicable federal regulations regarding employee compensation. If an employee works, for example, 45 hours in a workweek, they will be compensated at their regular rate for the first 40 hours worked and at 1.5 times their regular rate for the additional 5 hours worked.

The California WARN Act requires employers with 75 or more employees (including both full-time and part-time employees) to provide 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees before any mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. A \"mass layoff\" under California law is defined as a layoff during any 30-day period of 50 or more employees at a covered establishment. Therefore, if Acme Corp employs 75 or more individuals and a planned layoff will affect 50 or more employees at a single location within California within a 30-day period, then Acme Corp is required to provide written notification to the affected employees at least 60 days prior to the layoff date. This notice will include information about the layoff, including its expected duration, the reason for the layoff, and contact information for relevant resources.

This policy applies to all employees, regardless of their employment status (e.g., full-time, part-time, temporary), pay type (salaried or hourly), or the reason for termination (voluntary or involuntary). \"Termination\" as used in this policy refers to any separation of employment, whether initiated by the employee (resignation) or the employer (layoff or firing). For the purpose of this policy, the \"next regularly scheduled payday\" is defined as the payday established for the employee's department as described in Section 3.1 (Wage Payment Schedule). If an employee's termination date falls within a pay period, the final paycheck will include wages earned up to and including the last day worked. Employees are responsible for ensuring Acme Corp has their current mailing address so that the final paycheck can be mailed if direct deposit is no longer active.\nIn the event that an employee is terminated, and the termination notice given by the employee is not sufficient to ensure payment on their last day as may be requested, the employee will be paid on the next regular payday.\n\n**3.2.2 Contents of Final Paycheck**\n\nThe final paycheck will include all wages earned but not yet paid, including regular wages, overtime compensation (if applicable), accrued and unused vacation time (if applicable), and any other earned bonuses or commissions.

This policy outlines the interaction of these two laws. Employees working in California may be eligible for both FMLA and PFL concurrently under certain conditions.\n\nUnder the FMLA, eligible employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons. Please refer to Section 3.2.2 for detailed information regarding FMLA eligibility criteria and covered reasons. This leave will run concurrently with any leave taken under the California PFL program.\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL), on the other hand, provides eligible employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) with partial wage replacement benefits during a leave of absence to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member. The amount paid is typically between 60% and 70% of regular wages, depending on the employee\u2019s earnings. An employee is eligible for CA PFL if the employee.location_state is 'CA' and the employee.sdi_contributor is true and the employee.employment_status neq 'terminated'.\n\nEmployees should understand that while FMLA provides job protection, it does not provide wage replacement. Conversely, California PFL provides partial wage replacement but may not independently guarantee job protection beyond the protections provided by FMLA or other applicable laws. Approval for PFL is not guaranteed, as it depends on meeting the requirements stipulated by the California Employment Development Department (EDD).

This policy outlines the company\u2019s obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, both federal and California-specific, regarding mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notice Requirements**\n\nThe federal WARN Act generally applies when Synergy Solutions, Inc. employs 100 or more employees and implements a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment. California\u2019s WARN Act (Cal-WARN) has a lower threshold, applying to employers with 75 or more employees. Therefore, Synergy Solutions, Inc. must follow Cal-WARN when the layoff affects 50 or more employees in California if Synergy Solutions has 75 or more employees across all locations, regardless of whether or not 100 or more are employed. When determining if notice is required for employees in California, if Synergy Solutions, Inc.\u2019s total number of employees is less than or equal to 75 employees across all company locations, then no WARN notice is required. In cases where the layoffs are planned in multiple states, and the layoff includes employees in California, the California requirement will be independently assessed. Should the provisions of both the Federal and California WARN Acts apply, the company will adhere to the stricter requirements.\n\n**3.12.2 Notice Period**\n\nWhen a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation triggers the WARN Act requirements, Synergy Solutions, Inc. will provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 calendar days in advance of the planned action. The notice will include the expected date of the first separation, the anticipated duration of the layoff period (if applicable), and contact information for company representatives who can provide additional information.

This policy outlines the requirements for meal and rest breaks for our employees working in California, effective September 1, 2024. Please note that this policy only applies to active employees working within the State of California. This policy is subject to change without notice.\n\n**3.2.1 Meal Breaks:**\n\nNon-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during this break. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break is required, unless the total hours worked is less than twelve (12) hours, and the first meal break was properly provided. The employee and employer can agree to waive the second meal period if the total hours worked do not exceed 12 hours and the first meal period was not waived. Please refer to policy 3.2.3 concerning missed meal breaks for information concerning premium pay. Exempt employees are not covered under this policy.\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks:**\n\nNon-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken as close to the midpoint of the work period as possible. Employees are not required to remain on company premises during their rest break, but must return to work promptly at the end of the break.\n\n**3.2.3 Missed Meal and Rest Breaks:**\n\nIf a non-exempt employee in California is not provided a compliant meal or rest break as outlined above, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest break is not provided, irrespective of the number of missed breaks on that workday. Please contact Human Resources if you believe you have missed a meal or rest break and have not received the appropriate premium pay. Failure to report missed breaks in a timely manner may impact Acme Corp.'s ability to investigate and resolve the issue.

This requirement applies if the action results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees, provided that the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. Note, that for employees working in California, California\u2019s WARN Act extends similar protections, requiring notice when a covered establishment employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons. The state act also applies when there is a mass layoff of 50 or more employees, not just employees excluding part-time ones. Because Acme Corp. operates in multiple states, should the affected employees be located in California, this stricter employee threshold of 75 employees applies in that circumstance and the part-time employee exclusion does not apply. Note that the 75 employee rule applies to the total number of employees employed by the company. For clarity, a \"mass layoff\" is defined under the federal WARN act as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33 percent of the employees at the single site of employment.

This policy outlines the company's obligations when planning a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation in California.\n\n**3.12.1: Notification Requirements**\n\nIt is Acme Corp's policy to provide timely and appropriate notice to affected employees and relevant government agencies in the event of a qualifying mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. All decisions regarding workforce reductions will be made after careful consideration of operational needs and in compliance with applicable legal requirements. The following guidelines are applicable only for employees working in the state of California:\n\n*   **California WARN Act Applicability:** The California WARN Act applies to employers with 75 or more employees (full-time or part-time) in the preceding 12 months. A \"mass layoff\" under California law is defined as a layoff of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. Therefore, if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a single site of employment within California within a 30-day timeframe, the company is required to provide 60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government. This notice must contain specific information as required by the California WARN Act, including the reasons for the layoff, the expected date of the layoff, and the number of affected employees.\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act Applicability:** The federal WARN Act applies to employers with 100 or more employees (full-time or part-time).\n\n*   **Exceptions:** Certain exceptions to the WARN Act notification requirements may apply, such as unforeseeable business circumstances or natural disasters. Consult with the Legal Department for guidance on any potential exceptions. See also Section 9.0 (Employee Termination Procedures).\n\n**3.12.2: Coordination with Legal Department**\n\nThe HR Department, in conjunction with the Legal Department, is responsible for determining whether a planned workforce reduction triggers the notification requirements of the WARN Act or the California WARN Act. No workforce reduction plan involving the termination of 50 or more employees within California should be implemented without prior review and approval by the Legal Department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_mass_layoff\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees, and a mass layoff of 50 or more employees is planned at a single site of employment within California within a 30-day timeframe, the company is required to provide 60 days advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local government.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "compensation"}}

This requirement only applies if Apex Innovations has 100 or more employees company wide, regardless of location. This notice will be provided to each affected employee, their union representative (if any), the state workforce agency, and the local government. The notice will include information such as the date of the intended layoff, the expected duration of any temporary layoff, and contact information for company representatives. If Apex Innovations fails to provide the required notice, it may be subject to penalties as outlined in the WARN Act.

These provisions apply *only* to employees whose primary work location is in California. Please refer to Section 1.2, \"Geographic Scope of Policies,\" for clarification.\n\n**Meal Breaks:** If you are a non-exempt employee working a shift of more than five (5) hours in California, you are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes. This break should begin before your fifth hour of work is complete. If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a *second* unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes. This second meal break must be taken before the tenth hour of work is complete. Employees who work less than 6 hours, and who agree with their employer, may waive their meal period. Similarly, employees who work less than 12 hours, and who took one meal period, may waive their second meal period by mutual agreement with their employer.\n\n**Rest Breaks:** For every four (4) hours you work in California as a non-exempt employee, you are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break. To the extent practical, rest breaks should be in the middle of the four-hour work period. Rest breaks are considered \"time worked\" and you will be paid for them.\n\n**Premium Pay:** Acme Corp strives to provide all legally required meal and rest breaks. However, if a break is missed due to operational needs, you will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay at your regular rate of pay for each missed meal or rest break. This premium pay is intended to compensate you for the missed break opportunity.\n\nIt is your responsibility to accurately record your meal and rest breaks in the timekeeping system. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_break_eligibility\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you are a non-exempt employee working a shift of more than five (5) hours in California, you are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_second_meal_break_eligibility\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"second unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a *second* unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_rest_break_eligibility\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 4\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"paid rest break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For every four (4) hours you work in California as a non-exempt employee, you are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

This policy applies to all Acme Corp. employees working in the United States.\n\nGenerally, federal law, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), requires that terminated employees receive their final paycheck no later than the next regularly scheduled payday. However, California law, specifically California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, imposes stricter requirements.\n\nTherefore, this is how we will administer final pay. If an employee *voluntarily* terminates their employment with Acme Corp., and provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, their final paycheck, inclusive of all accrued and unused vacation time, will be available on their last day of employment. If the employee resigns without providing 72 hours' notice, they can expect their final paycheck within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. But if the employee is terminated *involuntarily*, the final paycheck will be available immediately upon termination, unless the employee's location_state is not 'CA'. If employee.location_state is not 'CA', the final paycheck will be available on the next regular payday, as required under federal law. It is the employee's responsibility to contact HR to arrange for the pickup of their final paycheck, or to provide a forwarding address for mailing. Failure to do so may result in delays in receiving their final pay. The employee should review their final paycheck stub to make sure all due wages were paid, and contact HR immediately with any discrepancies. Note that \"immediately\" can mean up to 24 hours to finalize payroll processing.\n\nSee section 5.1 regarding accrued vacation payout."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_timing_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timing\": \"immediately upon termination\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"But if the employee is terminated *involuntarily*, the final paycheck will be available immediately upon termination, unless the employee's location_state is not 'CA'.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This policy applies to all non-exempt employees of OptiCorp, regardless of location, except where otherwise noted. Employees are encouraged to review Section 2.1, \u201cEmployee Classifications,\u201d for clarification on exempt and non-exempt status.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility and Calculation**\n\nOptiCorp is committed to complying with both the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws regarding overtime pay.\n\n*   **Federal Overtime:** Under the FLSA, non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.\n\n*   **California Overtime:** For non-exempt employees working in California, California law mandates overtime pay for hours worked beyond eight (8) hours in a workday, or forty (40) hours in a workweek, whichever results in greater compensation to the employee. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Additionally, California law requires that for non-exempt employees working in California, those who work more than twelve (12) hours in a workday are entitled to twice their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond twelve (12) hours. This higher overtime rate also applies for the first eight hours worked on the seventh consecutive day in a workweek.\n\nIn accordance with these provisions, if an employee's location is California, and they are non-exempt, and they work more than 12 hours in a single workday, they are entitled to twice their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond 12 hours. All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor unless unforeseeable circumstances prevent such approval. The employee is responsible for accurately recording their time worked. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action.

This policy applies to all non-exempt employees working within the United States.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility and Calculation**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek, as defined by the FLSA. The workweek is defined as a fixed and regularly recurring period of seven consecutive 24-hour days. Any hours worked beyond 40 within this designated workweek will be compensated at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For the avoidance of doubt, an employee's classification as either exempt or non-exempt will be based on an individualized assessment of their job duties and responsibilities, in accordance with applicable federal law, as determined by Human Resources and documented in the employee's personnel file (see Policy 2.1 for classification guidelines). However, to clarify this, if an employee's hours worked weekly are at or below 40, and they are classified as non-exempt, no overtime compensation is applicable.\n\nFurthermore, it is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked, and all overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor. Failure to obtain pre-approval may result in disciplinary action, as detailed in Policy 7.2, even if the overtime hours are ultimately compensated, in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nIn instances where an employee has multiple rates of pay during a workweek, the \"weighted average\" method will be used to determine the overtime rate.

This policy is designed to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which is the federal law governing overtime pay. Please note that this policy applies to all Acme Corp employees located in the United States and is intended to adhere to federal overtime standards.\n\n**3.2.1 Overtime Eligibility**\n\nOvertime pay is provided to non-exempt employees for time worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. A \"workweek\" is defined as a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours -- seven consecutive 24-hour periods. Acme Corp's standard workweek begins at 12:00 AM on Sunday and ends at 11:59 PM on Saturday. Your classification as either \"exempt\" or \"non-exempt\" is determined by your job duties and responsibilities, as defined by the FLSA, and is indicated in your offer letter and payroll records. Any changes to your exemption status will be communicated to you in writing.\n\n**3.2.2 Overtime Compensation Rate**\n\nNon-exempt employees will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. This overtime premium is calculated based on the employee's regular hourly rate. This rate includes any non-discretionary bonuses, shift differentials, and other forms of compensation, as mandated by the FLSA. It is important to note that time off, such as vacation or sick leave, is not counted as \"hours worked\" for the purpose of calculating overtime. Therefore, if a non-exempt employee uses 8 hours of vacation time in a workweek and also works 35 hours, they would not be eligible for overtime pay.\nIf a non-exempt employee works 45 hours in a workweek, they will be paid for 40 hours at their regular rate of pay and 5 hours at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay. This additional pay for the 5 overtime hours is considered overtime compensation.\n\n**3.2.3 Reporting Overtime**\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked. Employees must submit their timesheets in a timely manner, in accordance with the instructions provided by their supervisor. Any discrepancies or questions regarding overtime pay should be brought to the attention of the employee's supervisor or the Human Resources Department as soon as possible. Failure to accurately report hours worked may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Veridian Dynamics provides family and medical leave to eligible California employees pursuant to the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), where applicable.\n\n3.4.2. **California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**. An employee who contributes to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) as determined by the State of California and whose employment status is active, may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for a qualifying event such as to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law. Benefits under PFL are administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and provide partial wage replacement as determined by the EDD, but shall not exceed eight (8) weeks within a twelve (12) month period. This duration shall run concurrently with any unpaid leave taken under the federal FMLA.\n\n3.4.3. **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**. Eligible employees, namely those whose tenure_months equals at least twelve (12) months and employer.employee_count_within_75_miles equals at least fifty (50), may take up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a twelve (12) month period for qualifying reasons as defined under FMLA, including but not limited to the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member.\n\n3.4.4. **Coordination of Leave**. To the extent an employee is eligible for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves shall run concurrently. Acceptance of PFL benefits does not extend the maximum leave duration beyond the twelve (12) weeks provided by FMLA. However, pursuant to internal policy section 2.5 regarding short term disability, an employee may apply for such benefits if the leave involves the employee's own serious health condition after other leave options are exhausted."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\":

It is designed to ensure compliance with both federal and California state law regarding overtime compensation. In cases where federal and state law differ, Sterling Innovations, Inc. will adhere to the law most beneficial to the employee.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility and Calculation**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. For California-based non-exempt employees, overtime is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Daily Overtime:** Employees are entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday. For example, if a non-exempt employee works 10 hours in a single day, they are entitled to overtime for the 2 hours exceeding 8.\n*   **Double Time:** Employees will be paid two (2) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday. Additionally, double time applies to all hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek. For example, if an employee works 14 hours one day, they are entitled to 2 hours of double time.\n*   **Weekly Overtime:** Regardless of daily hours, employees also receive overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. This ensures compliance with federal standards, even if the daily overtime rule has already been triggered. For instance, an employee might not work over 8 hours any single day, but if they accumulate more than 40 hours over the workweek, they are entitled to overtime for those excess hours.\n\nEmployees are responsible for accurately recording their work hours, in accordance with Section 2.2 (Timekeeping Procedures). Overtime must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor in order to be paid. Any unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_daily_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees are entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_double_time_daily\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees will be paid two (2) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_double_time_7th_day\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.consecutive_workdays\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": 7\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Additionally, double time applies to all hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_weekly_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Regardless of daily hours, employees also receive overtime pay at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Overtime Compensation\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "overtime", "rule_type": "leave"}}

This policy outlines the procedures for distributing final paychecks to employees whose employment with Acme Corp has ended, keeping in accordance with federal regulations.\n\nGenerally, final paychecks, including all accrued but unused vacation time (see Policy 4.1 Vacation and Paid Time Off), will be processed and distributed to the former employee on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee\u2019s last day of work. However, for employees who are involuntarily terminated as defined in Section 1.2 Definitions, and have completed at least twelve (12) months of continuous service with Acme Corp, the final paycheck will be made available for pick-up at the employee\u2019s primary worksite within 72 hours of termination, provided the Payroll Department receives notification of the termination prior to 12:00 PM Pacific Time on the employee\u2019s last day of work. If notification is received after this time, the paycheck will be available within 72 hours from the start of the next business day.

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave, complying with both federal and California state law where applicable.\n\n**5.2.1 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (as defined by the FMLA), or the employee's own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Bright Future Corp. for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave commencement date. Further, Bright Future Corp. must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA leave runs concurrently with other applicable leaves, such as California Paid Family Leave (PFL), when the reason for leave qualifies under both statutes.\n\n**5.2.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nFor employees who pay into California State Disability Insurance (SDI), California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits. Generally, PFL provides up to eight weeks of partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of wages, subject to change per state law) for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. However, if an employee's work location is not California or the employee's employment status is either terminated or resigned, they are not eligible for PFL benefits through Bright Future Corp, and should directly consult California state regulations for possible benefits eligibility. Coordination with FMLA leave is mandatory; the employee must simultaneously apply for both leaves if eligible.\n\n**5.2.3 Interplay of FMLA and PFL**\n\nIt is Bright Future Corp.\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding family and medical leave. Employees are encouraged to consult with the Human Resources Department to determine their eligibility and understand the interplay of FMLA and PFL benefits. Bright Future Corp. reserves the right to modify this policy at any time to comply with changes in applicable law.

This policy outlines the company\u2019s responsibilities regarding advance notification in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff. The requirements outlined in this section are intended to comply with federal law only and do not address state-specific WARN regulations.\n\n*   **General Notification Requirement:** NovaTech Solutions will provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice to affected employees before any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined below, affecting a site of employment.\n\n*   **Applicability:** This notification requirement applies if NovaTech Solutions employs 100 or more employees, not counting employees who have worked less than 6 months in the aggregate in the last 12 months or employees who work an average of less than 20 hours a week. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n*   **Mass Layoff Definition:** A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if those 50 or more employees comprise at least 33% of the active employees at that site, or 500 or more employees are impacted regardless of percentage. Employees who are laid off for less than six months are not considered terminated and therefore not part of the WARN Act calculation. Employment loss includes termination, layoff exceeding six months, or a reduction in hours of more than 50 percent during each month of any 6-month period.\n\n*   **Exclusions:** This policy does not apply to temporary layoffs, which are defined as layoffs lasting less than 6 months, or to employees who are offered a transfer to a different worksite within a reasonable commuting distance. This policy is subject to change as required by law. For any questions regarding this policy, please contact the HR Department.

This section outlines our Family and Medical Leave policies, adhering to both federal and California state laws.\n\n**3.5.1 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have worked for NovaTech Solutions for at least 12 months and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the start of the leave. Additionally, NovaTech Solutions must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA leave can be used for the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job. FMLA runs concurrently with other leaves where applicable. See Section 3.5.3 regarding interaction with California Paid Family Leave.\n\n**3.5.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nFor employees working in California who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI), California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits. Specifically, if you're a California employee paying into SDI, you may receive up to 8 weeks of paid leave at approximately 60-70% of your usual wages to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner), or participate in a qualifying event as defined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). This leave runs concurrently with FMLA where applicable, but the key difference is that PFL provides partial wage replacement while FMLA is unpaid.\n\n**3.5.3 Interaction of FMLA and PFL**\n\nWhen an employee qualifies for both FMLA and PFL for the same event, such as bonding with a new child, the leaves will run concurrently. This means that the 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave and the 8 weeks of partially paid PFL leave will overlap.\n\n**3.5.4 Requesting Leave**\n\nEmployees must provide NovaTech Solutions with advance notice of their intent to take family or medical leave, whenever possible.

Where the laws of the state in which an employee is working provide greater protection or benefits than federal law, Sterling Consolidated shall comply with the applicable state law to the extent required by law.

California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia PFL provides eligible employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) with partial wage replacement benefits while they take time off work to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. Benefits are typically paid at approximately 60-70% of the employee's wages, up to a maximum benefit amount as determined by the State of California. Eligibility for PFL benefits is determined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). The duration of paid leave under PFL is up to eight (8) weeks.\n\n**3.05.3. Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nFMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least twelve (12) months, and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave.

This includes full-time, part-time and hourly employees. Should Sterling Dynamics Inc. plan a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment within a 30-day period in California, the requirements of the California WARN Act will apply. Note: This is more stringent than the Federal WARN Act, which applies to employers with 100 or more employees.\n\n**(b) Notice Requirements:**\n\nIf a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation as defined by the California WARN Act is planned, Sterling Dynamics Inc. will provide affected employees with a written notice at least 60 calendar days in advance of the effective date of the action. This notice will include, at minimum, the expected date of the first separation, the anticipated schedule for terminations, and contact information for company representatives who can provide further information. Notices will also be provided to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the local workforce investment board, and the chief elected official of each city and county government where the layoff will occur.\n\n**(c) Employee Eligibility:**\n\nThe notice requirement described above applies to all Sterling Dynamics Inc. employees in California regardless of employee.employment_status or employee.classification that may be impacted by a qualifying event. This includes, but is not limited to, temporary, part-time, and salaried employees. Employees outside of California do not fall under this policy, and will be governed by applicable employment laws in their respective locations.\n\n**(d) Exceptions:**\n\nExceptions to the 60-day notice requirement may apply under certain circumstances, such as unforeseen business circumstances or natural disasters.

This policy outlines the company's guidelines for overtime compensation for all non-exempt employees working within the United States. For any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact the HR department.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay as defined by the FLSA. Overtime compensation is paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.\n\n**3.4.2 Overtime Calculation**\n\nOvertime is calculated on a weekly basis. An employee is eligible for overtime pay if their employee.hours_worked_weekly exceed forty (40) hours in a workweek. The workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM. All hours actually worked (excluding paid time off, such as vacation, sick leave, or holidays) are included when calculating the total hours worked in a workweek. If an employee.classification is non_exempt and employee.hours_worked_weekly is greater than 40, then Acme Corp. will grant compensation at 1.5 times their regular rate of pay for those overtime hours. Overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor.

However, it should be noted that Acme Corp is not responsible for determining PFL eligibility, as the EDD makes the final determination.

This policy applies exclusively to employees physically working within the state of California, and this policy should be read in conjunction with Section 2.1 (\"Employee Classifications\") of this handbook to determine applicability. This policy supersedes any previous Veridian Dynamics policies related to meal and rest breaks for California employees.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nAll non-exempt employees in California are entitled to a duty-free meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes when their total daily work period is more than five (5) hours. Unless explicitly waived in accordance with California Labor Code Section 512, a second duty-free meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes is required if the employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. However, employees working less than six (6) hours, while still non-exempt, may be exempt from this thirty-minute meal break as specified by California state law. Such employees should consult their managers to determine applicability. As per California regulations, in the event that an employee works between five and six hours, a written agreement may specify the rules for waiving such a meal break. Veridian Dynamics may face penalties as provided by law for failing to provide employees with required meal breaks. Veridian Dynamics also does not tolerate employees taking unauthorized breaks, and may take corrective actions.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt California employees are generally entitled to a paid rest period of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, during the workday. Rest breaks, to the extent feasible, should be taken in the middle of each work period.\n\n**3.4.3 Enforcement**\n\nVeridian Dynamics strives to adhere to the requirements of California law.

Acme Corp is committed to treating all employees with respect and dignity throughout any restructuring process.\n\n**3.12.A: Federal WARN Act Compliance**\n\nAcme Corp adheres to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.) at the federal level. The WARN Act mandates that covered employers provide 60 calendar days advance written notice to employees in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy and in accordance with federal regulations, a \"plant closing\" refers to the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees.\n\nA \"mass layoff,\" as defined under this policy, means a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for (A) 50 or more employees and that constitutes 33 percent of the employees at the single site of employment, or (B) 500 or more employees. Note that this policy only covers layoff events when the employer.employee_count is greater than or equal to 100. Therefore, if Acme Corp's employer.employee_count is less than 100, this policy does not apply. If an employee's location_state is in California, it is acknowledged that more stringent regulations may apply, however, Acme Corp will only comply with federal WARN guidelines as outlined above.

Because Acme Corp operates in multiple states, it's important to understand that this policy applies *only* to employees whose primary work location is in California. See Section 1.02 (\"Geographic Scope of Policies\") for clarification. Federal law generally dictates that final wages are due by the next regularly scheduled payday; however, California law provides stricter requirements.\n\nFor California-based employees whose employment ends involuntarily (e.g., termination or layoff), all earned wages, including accrued vacation time (see Section 3.07), must be made available for payment *immediately* at the time of termination. \"Immediately\" means wages are given to the employee at the time of separation or made available for pickup at the employee's regular work location, if reasonably feasible. If immediate payment is not feasible, wages must be mailed to the employee\u2019s address of record, postmarked no later than 24 hours following the termination. If an employee resigns, the timing of the final paycheck depends on whether they provided at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation. If an employee provides at least 72 hours of advance notice, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours advance notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of employment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Please note that wages are usually paid on the 15th and last day of each month. Therefore, there might be a slight delay within the 72 hours to allow payroll to generate the checks, but we strive to comply with state law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_involuntary\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timing\": \"immediately\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For California-based employees whose employment ends involuntarily (e.g., termination or layoff), all earned wages, including accrued vacation time (see Section 3.07), must be made available for payment *immediately* at the time of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "final_paycheck", "rule_type": "compensation"}}

This section outlines our policy regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Both laws may apply to you depending on your circumstances and location.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. FMLA applies to employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Reasons for leave include the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, or parent), or for your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job. For more detailed information, refer to the official FMLA guidelines.\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California employees who take time off work to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). If you work in California, contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI), and request leave for bonding with a new child, you are entitled to receive approximately 60-70% of your wages for up to 8 weeks through PFL. This benefit runs concurrently with any FMLA leave to which you are otherwise entitled.

This section details High Sierra Technologies' policy regarding meal and rest breaks for its employees working in the State of California, pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512. This policy is designed to ensure compliance with California law and to provide employees with necessary break periods during their work shifts. This policy specifically applies to all non-exempt employees of High Sierra Technologies who are working within the geographical boundaries of the State of California.\n\n3.4.2 Meal Breaks. Non-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours shall be provided with a duty-free meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes. The meal period should commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. A second meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes shall be provided to non-exempt employees working shifts longer than ten (10) hours. The second meal period must commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees are required to accurately record their meal periods.\n\n3.4.3 Rest Breaks. Non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid rest period of ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest periods should, to the extent practicable, be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period.\n\n3.4.4 Failure to Comply. High Sierra Technologies is committed to full compliance with California Labor Code requirements. Should High Sierra Technologies fail to provide a required meal or rest period, employees are entitled to one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided. This premium pay constitutes full compensation for the missed break.\n\n3.4.5 Termination for Repeated Violations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and consistent with Section 7.2 (Termination of Employment) of this Handbook, if an employee repeatedly, and without reasonable justification, fails to take required meal or rest breaks despite being provided the opportunity, and if such failure results in the Company being subject to penalties under California Law, that employee's employment may be subject to termination.

The procedures described herein apply to all Starlight Industries employees within the United States.\n\nGenerally, and subject to the conditions outlined below, an employee\u2019s final paycheck, which includes all accrued but unused vacation time as detailed in Section 5.2 (Vacation and Paid Time Off), will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's termination date. However, in cases of involuntary termination where the employee\u2019s last day of work falls within three (3) business days of the next scheduled payday, every effort will be made to provide the final paycheck on the employee\u2019s last day of work. This may be subject to administrative processing limitations. If an employee voluntarily resigns their position, and provides at least two (2) weeks' notice of their intent to resign, their final paycheck will also be issued on the next regular payday. Employees who resign without providing at least two weeks' notice may experience a delay in receiving their final paycheck, but it will be issued no later than the subsequent regular payday, contingent upon the return of all company property as specified in Section 8.1 (Company Property). In the event of any discrepancies, employees should immediately contact the Human Resources department for clarification. Nothing in this policy should be interpreted to supersede or conflict with applicable law, and where such conflict exists, applicable law shall control."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_timing_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"CA\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"terminated\",\n            \"resigned\",\n            \"laid_off\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timing\": \"next regularly scheduled payday\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Generally, and subject to the conditions outlined below, an employee\\u2019s final paycheck, which includes all accrued but unused vacation time as detailed in Section 5.2 (Vacation and Paid Time Off), will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's termination date.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"involuntary_termination_pay_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"CA\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timing\": \"every effort will be made to provide the final paycheck on the employee\\u2019s last day of work if termination occurs within three business days of payday\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, in cases of involuntary termination where the employee\\u2019s last day of work falls within three (3) business days of the next scheduled payday, every effort will be made to provide the final paycheck on the employee\\u2019s last day of work.

This section outlines our policies regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**5.2.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nEmployees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) are eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits for up to eight (8) weeks to employees who take time off work to:\n\n*   Bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement)\n*   Care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling).\n\nThe wage replacement benefit is typically 60-70% of the employee's usual wages, subject to state-mandated limits. PFL is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Please refer to the EDD website (www.edd.ca.gov) for detailed information on eligibility requirements and benefit amounts.\n\n**5.2.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. Acme Corp. adheres to all requirements under the FMLA. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must:\n\n*   Have been employed by Acme Corp. for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive);\n*   Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave; and\n*   Be employed at a worksite where Acme Corp. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\nFMLA leave may be taken for the following reasons:\n\n*   Birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   Placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n**5.2.3 Coordinating PFL and FMLA**\n\nEmployees eligible for both PFL and FMLA may take both leaves concurrently where the qualifying reasons overlap (e.g., bonding with a new child in California). In situations where an employee in the state of California has been terminated from Acme Corp, and the employee's tenure was under 12 months, the employee is ineligible to apply for FMLA. In such cases, the employee should not be granted FMLA leave.\n\n**5.2.4 Return to Work**\n\nUpon returning from PFL or FMLA leave, employees are generally entitled to be restored to their original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.\n\nEmployees should consult with HR for specific guidance on leave eligibility and coordination."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_termination_ineligible_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In situations where an employee in the state of California has been terminated from Acme Corp, and the employee's tenure was under 12 months, the employee is ineligible to apply for FMLA.

This policy is intended to comply with both applicable federal and state laws. Where federal and state laws differ, GoodCorp will adhere to the law that provides the greater benefit or protection to the employee.\n\n**3.4.2 California Employees**\n\nNotwithstanding Section 3.4.3, for employees working in California, the following provisions shall apply. Pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, all non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period. Said meal period must commence before the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. A second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period is required if the employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, to commence before the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work. Further, for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest period. Rest periods shall be scheduled, where feasible, in the middle of each four-hour work period. Non-exempt employees who are required to work through a compliant meal or rest break will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each day where one or more meal or rest breaks are missed. Employees that are classified as exempt are not entitled to meal or rest breaks under this section.\n\n**3.4.3 Employees Outside of California**\n\nFor employees located outside of California, while federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks, GoodCorp provides a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break for any employee working more than six (6) consecutive hours, provided that the employee is completely relieved of all duties during the break. Shorter breaks, up to twenty (20) minutes, provided during the workday will be treated as paid time.\n\n**3.4.4 Recordkeeping**\n\nAccurate recordkeeping of meal and rest breaks is essential to ensure compliance. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal periods in the timekeeping system. Any issues regarding break times should be immediately reported to the employee\u2019s supervisor.

This policy is designed to ensure compliance with California state law. It is the employee's responsibility to become familiar with these rules and manage their work accordingly. For any conflict between this policy and California law, California law prevails.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nEmployees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This meal break should ideally be taken before the end of the fifth hour of work. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during meal periods. Performing any work during a meal period, even minor tasks, violates this policy and California law. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring employees take their meal breaks.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nCalifornia employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks must be taken in the middle of each work period, as near as is practicable.\n\n**3.4.3 Missed Breaks**\n\nSterling Dynamic Solutions strives to provide employees with all required meal and rest breaks. If an employee is unable to take a required meal or rest break due to business necessity, the employee must report this to their supervisor as soon as possible.

It is designed to comply with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, and related regulations. While federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees, Sterling Consolidated is committed to providing legally required breaks to its California workforce.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nAll non-exempt employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. The meal break should commence no later than the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work. If a non-exempt employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This second meal period shall commence no later than the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during their meal break. If an employee is not relieved of all duties during their meal break, it is considered a missed meal break, which triggers premium pay as outlined in section 3.4.3.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken as near to the midpoint of the work period as possible. To clarify, an employee working 3.5 hours is eligible for a rest break.\n\n**3.4.3 Premium Pay for Missed Breaks**\n\nSterling Consolidated recognizes its obligation to provide required meal and rest breaks. If a non-exempt employee is not provided with a meal or rest break that complies with California law, the employee shall be paid one (1) hour of pay at their regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest break is not provided.

This policy outlines the company's approach to layoff notification, aligning with applicable federal regulations, specifically the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act).\n\nIn the unfortunate event that Acme Corp must conduct a mass layoff, it is our policy to provide advance written notice to affected employees. However, providing such notice is only triggered based on the aggregate circumstances of the event in question, and provided further that these circumstances are within our direct control. Notice is required only if a mass layoff, as defined under the federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101), is anticipated. For the purposes of this policy, a \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force, not resulting from a plant closing, which results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees who constitute at least 33% of the employees (excluding part-time employees) at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees.\n\nTherefore, in situations where *Acme Corp's* total employee count is greater than 100, and a layoff affecting at least 50 employees is anticipated, Acme Corp will provide those employees with a minimum of 60 days' written notice, unless unforeseen business circumstances prevent such advance notice, as defined in Section 3.13, Emergency Exceptions. All notifications must be issued in accordance with the regulations stipulated under the WARN Act. Compliance with the WARN Act is crucial, but this policy should not be interpreted as creating any contractual rights beyond those already provided by law.

Further, for employees classified as non-exempt who resign without providing at least two (2) weeks' written notice to their supervisor, as outlined in Section 6.1 (Voluntary Resignation), the final paycheck will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday.

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act is a federal law designed to protect workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide notification 60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs. This policy outlines Acme Corp's obligations under the federal WARN Act. Note this policy adheres only to the federal requirements, and does not provide additional or differing requirements of any state.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nAcme Corp will provide advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff as required by the federal WARN Act. A *plant closing* is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A *mass layoff* is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, excluding any part-time employees, or 500 or more employees are affected regardless of percentage. For the purposes of this policy, *employment loss* means (1) an employment termination, other than a discharge for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement; (2) a layoff exceeding 6 months; or (3) a reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during each month of any 6-month period.\n\nTherefore, Acme Corp will notify affected employees 60 calendar days in advance of a mass layoff if the number of affected employees in that mass layoff is greater than or equal to 50 and also represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, OR the number of affected employees is greater than or equal to 500, given the employer has 100 or more employees.\n\n**3.12.2 Notice Content**\n\nThe WARN notice will include, but is not limited to, the following information: the name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoff will occur; the nature of the planned action; the expected date of the first separation; a statement as to whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary; the job titles of positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each job classification; and contact information for company officials to contact for further information.\n\n**3.12.3 Exceptions**\n\n[Further exceptions would be detailed here, such as unforeseen business circumstances, natural disaster exceptions, etc. - not included as requested]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_act_notification_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 500\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"affected employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, Acme Corp will notify affected employees 60 calendar days in advance of a mass layoff if the number of affected employees in that mass layoff is greater than or equal to 50 and also represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, OR the number of affected employees is greater than or equal to 500, given the employer has 100 or more employees.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reductions and the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

If an employee resigns from ABC Corp, the final wages will be paid on the next regular payday regardless of whether notice was given. It is the employee's responsibility to provide a forwarding address to ABC Corp's Human Resources department. If an employee's employment status changes from active to terminated or laid_off, ABC Corp will mail the final paycheck to the employee's last known address.

All policies described below are subject to change without notice and are governed by applicable federal, state, and local laws. Where inconsistencies exist between this policy and applicable law, the law governs.\n\n**3.4.2 Paid Family Leave (California)**\n\nGolden Gate Technologies supports California employees who need time off for qualifying family reasons. California's Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, administered by the Employment Development Department (EDD), provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible employees who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a new child.\n\nEligibility for PFL benefits is generally determined by the EDD and is based on whether an employee pays into State Disability Insurance (SDI). Employees who contribute to SDI are likely eligible. If a California employee's tenure is greater than 12 months AND they have worked at least 1250 hours in the preceding 12-month period, they *may* also be eligible for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave, which runs concurrently with PFL. However, while FMLA provides job protection, it is typically unpaid. An employee taking leave for these reasons *shall* be granted PFL. However, for employees who *do not* pay into SDI, approval of an extended leave of absence is at the sole discretion of Human Resources, considering factors such as business needs and the employee's performance history, and this approval does *not* guarantee job protection. The maximum leave duration under PFL, as dictated by state law, is currently eight (8) weeks within a 12-month period, with wage replacement paid at approximately 60-70% of the employee's normal wages, subject to EDD calculations. Details regarding filing a PFL claim can be found on the EDD website (www.edd.ca.gov). Please note that using PFL does not necessarily protect your job; job protection is governed by other applicable laws such as FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_grant_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"PFL leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"An employee taking leave for these reasons *shall* be granted PFL.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Golden Gate Technologies - Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "leave"}}

For the avoidance of doubt, this policy does not apply to employees whose work location is outside of California, notwithstanding their occasional travel to California for business purposes.\n\n3.2.2. **Overtime Rate:** Subject to the provisions detailed herein, non-exempt employees in California shall be compensated for overtime hours worked. \"Overtime hours\" are defined as hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a single workday or forty (40) hours in a single workweek. The rate of overtime pay shall be one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, unless otherwise specified below.\n\n3.2.3. **Daily and Weekly Overtime:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they shall be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond the twelfth hour in that workday. Furthermore, if a non-exempt employee works more than eight (8) hours on their seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, compensation for hours exceeding eight (8) shall be calculated at two (2) times their regular rate of pay. The determination of whether the employee is subject to California's overtime regulations will be based solely on their primary work location, irrespective of the location of the project or client they are assigned to. However, should an employee's classification change to exempt status pursuant to California law and this policy, the provisions outlined in this section shall no longer apply.\n\n3.2.4. **Payment:** Overtime compensation shall be included in the employee's regular paycheck for the pay period during which the overtime hours were worked, in accordance with California Labor Code Section 204.

Revision Number: 1.2\n\nIt is the policy of Apex Solutions, Inc. to provide eligible employees with leave benefits in accordance with both the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, as amended. In circumstances where an employee is eligible for both PFL and FMLA, the leave entitlements shall run concurrently, to the maximum extent permitted by law. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, eligibility for continued employment with Apex Solutions, Inc. under this Section is explicitly contingent upon full compliance with Section 2.12 regarding employee conduct and performance expectations, as determined in the sole discretion of the Company.\n\n**3.09.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nPursuant to California Unemployment Insurance Code Sections 3300 et seq., employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits, calculated at approximately sixty percent (60%) to seventy percent (70%) of their regular earnings, while taking leave to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law. Benefits are administered directly by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the employee\u2019s continued employment with Apex Solutions, Inc. is subject to the employee not having any active performance improvement plans at the commencement of the leave, such performance plan having been initiated prior to the employee's notification of planned leave, and employee providing Apex Solutions, Inc. with medical documentation. Any employee found to be in violation of this, as determined by Apex Solutions in its reasonable discretion, will be terminated.\n\n**3.09.3 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees, as defined by the FMLA, are entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. Eligibility for FMLA leave requires that the employee has been employed by Apex Solutions, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the leave.

This policy outlines the requirements for Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL). Eligibility for both FMLA and PFL may run concurrently where applicable.\n\n**3.12.1 Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees may be granted up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons, as defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have been employed by Synergistic Solutions Inc. for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Furthermore, FMLA only applies to sites with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. Leave may be taken for the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, or for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's job. Please refer to Appendix A for the full definition of \"serious health condition.\"\n\n**3.12.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits for up to eight (8) weeks when taking time off to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). The wage replacement rate is currently 60-70% of the employee's wages.

This policy applies to all employees working in the United States.\n\n**3.4.1 General Principles:**\n\nVeridian Dynamics is committed to providing employees with legally required meal and rest breaks. To ensure a productive and healthy work environment, we adhere to the following guidelines. The details of these guidelines depend on the laws of the jurisdiction where the employee works. Please consult with HR if you have any questions.\n\n**3.4.2 Federal Regulations:**\n\nUnder federal law, Veridian Dynamics is not required to provide meal or rest breaks to adult employees. However, when provided, any breaks shorter than 20 minutes are counted as hours worked and must be paid. Meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) do not need to be compensated when the employee is completely relieved of all job duties during the break.\n\n**3.4.3 California Regulations:**\n\nFor Veridian Dynamics employees working in California, the following regulations apply in addition to the federal regulations noted above:\n\n*   **Meal Breaks:** Employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. The meal break must commence before the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work, and the second meal break (if applicable) must commence before the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees are required to accurately record their meal breaks on their timesheets.\n\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks must be taken in the middle of each four (4) hour work period, as much as is practicable.\n\n*   **Premium Pay for Missed Breaks:** Consistent with California law, if Veridian Dynamics does not provide an employee with a required meal or rest break, the employee will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each missed break.\n\n**3.4.4 Policy Enforcement:**\n\nSupervisors are responsible for ensuring that all employees, particularly those in California, have the opportunity to take their required meal and rest breaks. Employees are responsible for taking their breaks and accurately recording them on their timesheets. Willful failure to adhere to this policy can result in disciplinary action. Any employee who believes that they have been improperly denied a meal or rest break should report the matter immediately to their supervisor or Human Resources. The Company prohibits any retaliatory action against any employee who reports a violation or suspected violation of this policy. For more on reporting concerns, please refer to Section 5.2 of this handbook on Ethical Conduct.\n\n**3.4.5 Exceptions**\nNon-exempt Veridian Dynamics employees in California who work shifts longer than ten hours are eligible for a second 30 minute unpaid meal break."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"second 30 minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt Veridian Dynamics employees in California who work shifts longer than ten hours are eligible for a second 30 minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Veridian Dynamics Employee Handbook \\u2013 Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "leave"}}

Employees should contact the Human Resources department with any questions regarding their final paycheck. Please refer to Section 2.15 for details on our standard payday schedule.\n\n*   **Federal Compliance:** Evergreen Solutions Corp. will adhere to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding final paychecks for all employees, regardless of location.

This policy outlines the provisions for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**4.3.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are eligible for PFL benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of wages, subject to change based on state law) for up to eight (8) weeks within a twelve (12) month period. PFL can be used to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). Eligibility for PFL is determined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and employees must meet their criteria to qualify. Please refer to the EDD website ([invalid URL removed]) for comprehensive details regarding eligibility and benefit amounts.\n\n**4.3.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees are also covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave within a twelve (12) month period. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must (a) have worked for Skyline Dynamics Corporation for at least twelve (12) months, and (b) have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the start of the leave. FMLA leave can be used for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, or spouse), or for the employee's own serious health condition. The determination of what constitutes a \"serious health condition\" will be based on federal regulations.\n\n**4.3.3 Coordination of PFL and FMLA**\nIt is Skyline Dynamics Corporation\u2019s policy to have PFL and FMLA run concurrently when the leave qualifies under both laws. However, should an employee take leave for bonding, and subsequent action is taken by the employee that results in termination within thirty (30) days of the end of said leave due to the employee having provided false information regarding their need for leave, then the employee may forfeit rights under both PFL and FMLA depending on the nature of the deception.

This policy outlines our requirements for providing such breaks. Employees are responsible for adhering to this policy and accurately recording their break times.\n\n**General Policy:** All non-exempt employees are generally entitled to rest and meal breaks. The specific requirements vary depending on the state in which the employee works.\n\n**California Employees:** In compliance with California law, non-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal period. A second 30-minute meal period is required for non-exempt employees working shifts longer than ten (10) hours. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during meal periods.\n\nAdditionally, California law mandates a paid ten (10)-minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks must be counted as time worked. These rest periods should, to the extent practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period.\n\n**Federal Considerations:** Federal law does not require meal or rest periods. However, any breaks of short duration (generally five (5) to twenty (20) minutes) offered to employees must be paid. Meal periods (typically thirty (30) minutes or longer) are generally not required to be paid, provided the employee is completely relieved of duty.\n\n**Premium Pay for Missed Breaks:** It is Sterling Consolidated\u2019s policy to provide compliant meal and rest breaks. However, if an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest period in accordance with California law, due to operational needs or other unforeseen circumstances, the employee may be entitled to one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided. If the employee\u2019s shift is less than 3.5 hours, then the employee is not eligible to have a rest break provided as stated in the California Labor Code Section 512.\n\n**Reporting Missed Breaks:** Any employee who believes they have been denied a compliant meal or rest break should immediately notify their supervisor and Human Resources. (See Section 5.2 \u2013 Complaint Procedures.) Failure to report missed breaks in a timely manner may affect the Company\u2019s ability to investigate and resolve the issue.\n\n**Policy Changes:** Sterling Consolidated reserves the right to modify this policy at any time.

This section outlines the company's policy on overtime pay for non-exempt employees. As a general rule, non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked over 40 in a single workweek. The calculation of overtime pay will be one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for each hour of overtime worked, as determined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nThere are, however, some exceptions and clarifications to this rule. For example, if an employee's employment status is anything other than \u2018active\u2019 as defined in section 2.10, no overtime compensation will be provided. Furthermore, an employee must be on Acme Corp's payroll at the time overtime compensation is paid. Employees classified as \u2018exempt\u2019 under the FLSA are not eligible for overtime pay, regardless of the number of hours worked in a week. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked in the company's timekeeping system. Failure to do so may result in delays or inaccuracies in overtime pay calculations.\n\nSpecifically, for hourly non-exempt employees in good standing, Acme Corp will provide overtime pay at a rate of 1.5x their regular hourly rate when the employee's hours worked weekly exceeds 40, with consideration also given to section 4.2 regarding approved leave impacting overall workweek totals. This policy is intended to comply with all federal labor guidelines related to overtime, and applies to all employees regardless of where their work is physically performed.

While federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees, OptiCorp provides breaks in accordance with the following guidelines:\n\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Employees are permitted to take short, paid rest breaks during their work shift. These breaks are intended to allow employees to briefly step away from their work to refresh themselves.\n*   **Meal Breaks:** Employees are permitted to take longer, unpaid meal breaks to eat a meal away from their workstation.\n\n**3.4.2 Eligibility for Breaks**\n\nAs per federal law, OptiCorp does not require meal or rest breaks, but does permit employees to take them. If an employee works a shift that is six hours or longer, and employee.location_state is not California, OptiCorp permits the employee to take an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes in duration, during which the employee must be completely relieved of all duties. Please refer to Section 2.2, \"Hours of Work,\" for additional information regarding overtime and scheduling. For questions regarding specific break schedules or needs, please contact your supervisor or the Human Resources Department. This policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.\n\n**3.4.3 Recording Breaks**\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all meal and rest breaks taken, in accordance with company timekeeping procedures, as detailed in Section 4.5, \"Timekeeping and Payroll.\" Failure to accurately record break times may result in disciplinary action."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30,\n          \"pay_status\": \"unpaid\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee works a shift that is six hours or longer, and employee.location_state is not California, OptiCorp permits the employee to take an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes in duration, during which the employee must be completely relieved of all duties.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"OptiCorp Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

Nothing in this policy should be construed as creating a right to meal or rest breaks for employees outside of California. This policy supersedes any prior company policies relating to meal and rest breaks for California employees.\n\n**3.4.2 Meal Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt California employees shall be provided with a meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes for each work period totaling more than five (5) hours, unless the employee's total hours worked for that day are no more than six (6) hours, in which case the meal period may be waived by mutual written agreement between the employee and the Company. Further, if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, the employee shall be provided with a second meal period of no less than thirty (30) minutes, unless the employee's total hours worked for that day are no more than twelve (12) hours, in which case the second meal period may be waived by mutual written agreement between the employee and the Company. The meal period shall be unpaid, and the employee must be completely relieved of all duties during this period. Employees are required to record their meal breaks accurately in the timekeeping system.\n\n**3.4.3 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt California employees shall be authorized and permitted to take a paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks shall be taken as near as practical to the midpoint of the four-hour work period.\n\n**3.4.4 Premium Pay for Missed Breaks**\n\nPursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7, if the Company fails to provide an employee with a meal or rest period in accordance with this policy, the Company shall pay the employee one (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided. However, this provision shall not apply to employees whose employment status is terminated or laid off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_missed_break_pay_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"laid_off\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employer to pay one (1) hour of pay at the employee\\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7, if the Company fails to provide an employee with a meal or rest period in accordance with this policy, the Company shall pay the employee one (1) hour of pay at the employee\\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided.

Acme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable federal wage and hour laws regarding final pay. This policy applies to all employees of Acme Corp throughout the United States.\n\nGenerally, Acme Corp will provide a final paycheck to a terminated employee on the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination date. This paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including any accrued and unused vacation time (as described in Section 4.01, Vacation Policy). An employee's employment_status must be something other than *active* to trigger this final pay process. Employees classified as *exempt* or *non_exempt* will both receive final pay based on this policy. Regardless of whether the termination is *voluntary* or *involuntary*, the final paycheck will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday.\n\nFor purposes of clarity, the phrase \"regularly scheduled payday\" refers to the standard payday schedule established by Acme Corp, which is bi-weekly on Fridays. Any wages earned up to and including the date of termination will be included in the final paycheck. If an employee's final paycheck cannot be delivered via the employee\u2019s usual method of payment (e.g., direct deposit), it will be mailed to the employee's last known address as on file with the Human Resources department.

This act requires the company to provide advance written notice to affected employees and relevant government entities in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, as defined below:\n\n*   **Mass Layoff:** A reduction in force that results in the termination of 50 or more employees within any 30-day period, where those employees represent at least 33% of the active workforce at the affected establishment.\n*   **Plant Closure:** The shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, resulting in the termination of 50 or more employees within any 30-day period.\n*   **Relocation:** The removal of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations of an employer to a different location 100 miles or more away from the original location.\n\nAcme Corp will provide 60 days advance written notice of any mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local workforce investment board, provided that *both* the employer has 75 or more employees (regardless of full-time or part-time status) *and* the mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects 50 or more employees. The 75 employee threshold for California is lower than the 100 employee threshold under the federal WARN act; Acme Corp will always abide by the more stringent requirements of the California WARN act for employees whose employee.location_state is CA.

This policy outlines the procedures for the disbursement of final paychecks to employees whose employment with SCDP has ended, whether through resignation, termination, layoff, or other separation from employment. Final paychecks will include all earned but unpaid wages, including but not limited to, regular wages, accrued vacation time (subject to Policy 3.3.1: Vacation Accrual and Usage), and any other earned compensation.\n\nGenerally, SCDP strives to disburse final paychecks as soon as administratively feasible. However, specific timing may vary depending on the circumstances of the employee's separation and the applicable jurisdiction. For employees not located in California, final paychecks will be issued no later than the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's last day of employment, as per the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nCalifornia employees present a nuanced situation.

This policy applies *exclusively* to employees physically working in the State of California. This policy supplements, and does not replace, other Sterling Consolidated policies, including Section 2.1 regarding work schedules and Section 4.5 regarding timekeeping. All California employees are required to accurately record their meal and rest breaks in the company timekeeping system.\n\n**Meal Breaks:**\n\nIn accordance with California Labor Code Sections 512 and 516, employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This break must commence before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This second meal break must commence before the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during their meal breaks. Employees are free to leave the premises during their meal breaks. Any California employee classified as non-exempt who has worked at Sterling Consolidated for less than six months and is scheduled to work more than 8 hours daily, but whose employment status is *not* in \"terminated\", \"resigned\", or \"laid_off\" statuses, must have their schedule reviewed by their manager to ensure meal break compliance.\n\n**Rest Breaks:**\n\nCalifornia employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, to the extent practicable, be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period.\n\n**Missed Breaks:**\n\nIf an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, Sterling Consolidated will pay the employee one (1) hour of premium pay for each missed break, in accordance with California law.

This policy outlines the provisions for Family and Medical Leave, adhering to both federal and state laws. Employees should also refer to Section 3.5, entitled \"Other Leave Options\" for information about bereavement and other leave types.\n\n**3.4.2 Eligibility for Family and Medical Leave**\nEmployees who meet the eligibility requirements outlined in both the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL) are entitled to certain benefits, although these may not necessarily run concurrently. FMLA, a federal law, provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by federal regulation. Eligibility for FMLA requires that the employee has been employed by Sterling Consolidated for at least 12 months, and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months preceding the leave. Sterling Consolidated calculates the number of employees within 75 miles of a worksite according to guidelines established in the FMLA regulations, in order to make determinations about coverage under FMLA.\n\n**3.4.3 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides wage replacement benefits to eligible employees who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a new child. PFL is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and is funded through employee contributions to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. Employees who contribute to SDI are eligible for PFL benefits, up to 8 weeks at approximately 60-70% of their usual weekly wage. This benefit is not guaranteed and is subject to approval by the EDD based on their guidelines. If an employee is eligible for both FMLA and PFL for the same qualifying event and their location_state is California, they may initially take FMLA leave and then supplement with PFL, or vice-versa, though in no case will Sterling Consolidated supplement these payments to bring the employee to their full usual weekly wage, regardless of employee classification."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_wage_replacement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"partial wage replacement during leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"percentage\": \"60-70\",\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides wage replacement benefits to eligible employees who take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a new child.

United Global Solutions, Inc. is committed to ensuring employee well-being and compliance with all applicable federal regulations. Nothing in this policy should be construed as creating any rights or obligations beyond those mandated by federal law.\n\n3.4.2. **Applicability:** This policy applies to all non-exempt employees of United Global Solutions, Inc. throughout the United States, subject to applicable federal law. Exempt employees are not subject to the provisions of this policy.\n\n3.4.3. **Meal Breaks:** In accordance with federal law, United Global Solutions, Inc. is not required to provide meal breaks. However, if United Global Solutions, Inc. elects to provide meal periods of thirty (30) minutes or more, such breaks will be unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities during the entirety of the break. If the employee is not completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities, the meal period will be considered working time and must be compensated accordingly. Employees who voluntarily choose to work during their scheduled meal period may do so, but will only be compensated if they have explicit prior approval from their supervisor or manager to perform work during that time. This policy also incorporates Policy 3.7 regarding overtime compensation, which requires that all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek be compensated at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\n3.4.4. **Rest Breaks:** United Global Solutions, Inc. is not federally required to provide rest breaks to adult employees.

This policy outlines the procedures for mass layoffs and plant closures as defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.). Note that this policy reflects federal regulations; individual states may have their own, potentially stricter, requirements regarding mass layoffs and plant closures, and it is the employee's responsibility to understand the regulations applicable to them. AlphaCorp will aim to provide advance notice of workforce reductions wherever possible, balancing legal obligations with the operational needs of the business.\n\n*   **WARN Act Notice Requirement:** In accordance with the federal WARN Act, AlphaCorp is required to provide sixty (60) calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees before any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined below, unless unforeseen circumstances exist. While the spirit of the law is intended to apply where 50 or more employees are impacted, any reduction in force must meet the federal guidelines. Note that this requirement is activated, however, only if the employer (AlphaCorp) has 100 or more employees company-wide. The determination of whether a mass layoff or plant closing has occurred is complex and will be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with legal counsel. If it is determined that AlphaCorp employs at least 100 individuals across all locations and a mass layoff as defined under federal guidelines impacts an active employee, AlphaCorp must provide 60 days advance notice of termination. For clarification on what constitutes \"active\" status, please refer to section 2.01.\n\n*   **Definitions:**\n    *   **Plant Closing:** The permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding any part-time employees.\n    *   **Mass Layoff:** A reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees, regardless of percentage of employees at the single site of employment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_act_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance notice of termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If it is determined that AlphaCorp employs at least 100 individuals across all locations and a mass layoff as defined under federal guidelines impacts an active employee, AlphaCorp must provide 60 days advance notice of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

Golden Gate Technologies, Inc. is committed to treating all employees fairly and ethically during any workforce reduction. This policy is designed to ensure compliance with both the federal WARN Act and the California WARN Act, recognizing that the California WARN Act provides broader employee protections.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nIn the event of a plant closing, relocation, or mass layoff affecting employees in California, Golden Gate Technologies, Inc. will adhere to the following notification requirements:\n\n*   **California WARN Act Applicability:** Golden Gate Technologies, Inc. will comply with the California WARN Act if the company employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons in California. This calculation includes both full-time and part-time employees.\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act Applicability:** If Golden Gate Technologies, Inc. employs 100 or more employees, the Federal WARN Act will also be applicable, regardless of whether the California WARN Act is triggered. Should both Acts apply, the provisions affording the greater protection to employees will be followed.\n\n*   **Notification Thresholds and Timing:** We will provide written notice at least 60 days prior to any covered plant closing, relocation, or mass layoff. A \"mass layoff\" under the California WARN Act is defined as a layoff of 50 or more employees within any 30-day period.

The California WARN Act, with stricter regulations, applies to employers with 75 or more employees and requires the same 60-day notice for a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. If Apex Solutions, Inc. initiates a mass layoff that impacts at least 50 employees and the employer.employee_count is greater than or equal to 75 and if at least one employee is located in the state of california (employee.location_state eq CA) the company is required to notify affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials at least 60 days prior to the date of the first termination.

However, should an employee\u2019s employment status change from active to terminated due to a plant closure as defined under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, final payment shall be distributed in accordance with the WARN Act requirements, but no later than the next regularly scheduled payday unless specifically precluded by federal statute.\n\n3.12.3 **Method of Payment:** All final paychecks will be disbursed according to the employee\u2019s elected method of payment, as on file with the Payroll Department.\n\n3.12.4 **Deductions:** All legally required and authorized deductions will be withheld from the final paycheck."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_timing_regular\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"issue final paycheck on next regularly scheduled payday\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), final paychecks for employees whose employment is terminated, regardless of whether the termination is voluntary or involuntary, shall be issued on the company's next regularly scheduled payday following the date of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_timing_terminated\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"issue final paycheck on next regularly scheduled payday\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), final paychecks for employees whose employment is terminated, regardless of whether the termination is voluntary or involuntary, shall be issued on the company's next regularly scheduled payday following the date of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_collective_bargaining\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"issue final paycheck per CBA terms\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding subsection (a), if an employee is terminated involuntarily and such employee\\u2019s employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement that dictates a different timeframe for the issuance of final paychecks, the terms of that collective bargaining agreement shall supersede the requirements of subsection (a) to the extent permissible under federal law.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_paycheck_warn_act\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\",\n            \"relocation\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"issue final paycheck per WARN Act requirements, but no later than next regularly scheduled payday.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, should an employee\\u2019s employment status change from active to terminated due to a plant closure as defined under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, final payment shall be distributed in accordance with the WARN Act requirements, but no later than the next regularly scheduled payday unless specifically precluded by federal statute.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This adheres to California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202.\n\nHowever, if an employee voluntarily resigns, and provides at least 72 hours of advance notice of their resignation to their supervisor, their final paycheck will also be available immediately upon their last day of employment. Failure to provide the required notice will result in final pay being available within 72 hours of the resignation date.

This policy applies to all NeoTech Solutions employees, but certain provisions are specifically applicable to employees working in California, given the more stringent requirements of California law. Employees should also refer to Section 2.1 (\"Work Hours\") for definitions related to work schedules.\n\n**Meal Breaks:**\n\n*   **Federal Law:** While federal law does not mandate meal breaks for adult employees, NeoTech Solutions provides meal breaks to promote employee well-being and productivity. Generally, meal breaks of at least 30 minutes are provided to employees whose daily work schedule exceeds five (5) hours. Under federal law, these breaks are unpaid if the employee is completely relieved of all work duties during the meal period.\n*   **California Law:** For employees working in California, if an employee's workday exceeds five (5) hours, they are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break. If the workday exceeds ten (10) hours, California employees are entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. These meal breaks must commence no later than the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work and tenth (10th) hour of work, respectively. Failure to provide these meal breaks to non-exempt employees in California will result in one (1) hour of premium pay to the employee for each workday that a meal break is not provided. See Section 3.5 (\"Premium Pay\") for details. An employee can waive the meal period if the total hours worked does not exceed six (6) hours. A second meal period can be waived only if the total hours worked do not exceed 12 hours and the first meal period was taken.\n\n**Rest Breaks:**\n\n*   **California Law:** Employees working in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.

This policy applies to all employees of Atlas Dynamics, Inc. throughout the United States, notwithstanding any state or local laws that may provide for different or additional requirements. To the extent that any state or local law provides greater benefits or protections to employees than this policy, the employee is only entitled to the protections granted under federal law.\n\n3.4.2 **Meal Breaks.** Pursuant to federal law, the Company is not required to provide meal breaks to its employees.

If an employee is not completely relieved of duties during a meal period of thirty (30) minutes or more, the employee shall be compensated for that time. All employees are expected to record their meal breaks accurately in the Company's timekeeping system, in accordance with Section 3.5, \u201cTimekeeping and Payroll.\u201d\n\n3.4.3 **Rest Breaks.** While federal law does not mandate rest periods, should the Company provide rest periods of short duration, specifically five (5) to twenty (20) minutes, such rest periods shall be considered hours worked and shall be compensated at the employee's regular rate of pay. The Company retains the right to determine the scheduling and duration of any such rest periods, taking into consideration operational needs and employee well-being. Employees are required to remain on Company premises during such rest periods, unless otherwise authorized by their supervisor. The failure to return to the work station following the allocated rest break may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n3.4.4 **Exempt Employees.** Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the provision of meal or rest breaks to employees who are properly classified as exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_unpaid_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"meal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.duration_minutes\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"meal break to be unpaid\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if the Company elects to provide meal periods of thirty (30) minutes or more, such meal periods shall be unpaid, provided that the employee is completely relieved of all job duties during the entirety of the meal period.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_paid_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"meal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.duration_minutes\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee to be compensated for the meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee is not completely relieved of duties during a meal period of thirty (30) minutes or more, the employee shall be compensated for that time.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"rest_break_paid_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"rest\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.duration_minutes\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.duration_minutes\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 20\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"rest periods shall be compensated at the employee's regular rate of pay\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"While federal law does not mandate rest periods, should the Company provide rest periods of short duration, specifically five (5) to twenty (20) minutes, such rest periods shall be considered hours worked and shall be compensated at the employee's regular rate of pay.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"exempt_no_breaks_004\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"provision of meal or rest breaks\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the provision of meal or rest breaks to employees who are properly classified as exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "leave"}}

To qualify for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Sunrise Technologies for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Additionally, Sunrise Technologies must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for the birth and care of a newborn child, for placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition, or when the employee is unable to work due to a serious health condition.\n\nEmployees who work primarily in California and contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) may also be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a new child. Leave taken under California PFL will run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement, where the employee is otherwise eligible for both, provided the employee\u2019s reason for leave qualifies under both laws. For clarity, employees classified as \"exempt\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are expected to utilize paid time off (PTO) concurrently with any FMLA leave before accessing unpaid leave, in line with Section 5.2 of this handbook.

Employees must file a claim directly with the EDD.\n\n6.3.3. **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** Under the FMLA, eligible employees are entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for certain qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, or for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition. OptiCorp adheres to the FMLA requirements, which generally apply to employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\n6.3.4. **Coordination of Leave:** When an employee qualifies for both PFL and FMLA leave for the same qualifying reason, the leaves shall run concurrently. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an employee is terminated and is otherwise eligible for PFL due to a qualifying event that occurred prior to their termination, then that employee may still be eligible to receive PFL benefits from the State of California."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_post_termination\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"medical\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"PFL benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an employee is terminated and is otherwise eligible for PFL due to a qualifying event that occurred prior to their termination, then that employee may still be eligible to receive PFL benefits from the State of California.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"OptiCorp HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "restriction"}}

Purpose**\n\nThis section outlines ACME Corporation's policy regarding overtime compensation for non-exempt employees located in California, pursuant to applicable California Labor Code provisions, including but not limited to Sections 510 and 515. This policy is effective as of January 1, 2024, and supersedes all prior policies relating to overtime compensation for California-based employees. Revisions to this policy will be communicated to employees as they occur.\n\n**3.4.2. Eligibility**\n\nThis overtime policy applies solely to non-exempt employees of ACME Corporation whose primary work location is within the State of California. Exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California law, are not eligible for overtime compensation. The determination of exempt or non-exempt status is made in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations. Questions regarding employee classification should be directed to the Human Resources Department.\n\n**3.4.3. Overtime Compensation**\n\nNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary, for non-exempt employees physically working in California, overtime shall be paid in accordance with California law. Consequently, if an employee's `employee.location_state` is 'CA' and their `employee.classification` is 'non_exempt', they shall be compensated at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday, or for the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any workweek, or for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek. For all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday, or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on any seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, employees shall be compensated at two (2) times their regular rate of pay.\n\n**3.4.4. Meal and Rest Breaks**\n\nCompliance with California's meal and rest break requirements is mandatory. Please refer to Section 4.2 of this handbook for detailed information.\n\n**3.4.5. Record Keeping**\n\nAccurate timekeeping is essential. Employees are responsible for accurately recording all hours worked, including overtime hours.

If a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure, as defined under California Labor Code Section 1400, affects fifty (50) or more employees at a single site of employment within the State of California during any thirty (30)-day period, Acme Corp. shall provide sixty (60) days advance written notice of such action to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the chief elected official of the local government. Provided, however, if Acme Corp.'s total number of employees, irrespective of location, is less than seventy-five (75), the California WARN Act shall not apply. For the avoidance of doubt, employees on temporary layoff or leave of absence are still included in the calculation of the total number of employees.

Overtime pay is provided to eligible employees as required by federal and state law. It's important to understand that these rules can be complex, and any questions should be directed to the HR Department for clarification. All non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. \"Exempt\" and \"non-exempt\" classifications are determined in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws.\n\nFor employees located outside of California, Acme Corp follows the federal FLSA guidelines, meaning overtime is paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek.\n\nCalifornia employees, however, are subject to California's stricter overtime rules. In California, overtime is paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday or forty (40) in a workweek. Furthermore, California law requires double time pay (2x the regular rate) for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday. If an employee in California consistently exceeds eight hours daily, five days per week over a six month period and has previously been issued documented verbal and written warnings, or has been terminated for performance issues in the past, and where employee.age is over 50, then the company can terminate their employment, unless otherwise specified in a collective bargaining agreement. All overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's manager. No employee is authorized to work overtime without prior authorization. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the workweek begins on Sunday at 12:00 AM and ends on Saturday at 11:59 PM."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"terminate_excessive_overtime_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.age\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"termination of employment\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee in California consistently exceeds eight hours daily, five days per week over a six month period and has previously been issued documented verbal and written warnings, or has been terminated for performance issues in the past, and where employee.age is over 50, then the company can terminate their employment, unless otherwise specified in a collective bargaining agreement.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "overtime", "rule_type": "termination"}}

To determine if you are eligible for overtime compensation, the following rules apply. If a non-exempt employee works over eight (8) hours in a workday within the state of California, they will receive overtime pay for all hours worked over eight (8) at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay. Hours worked must be actually worked; paid time off such as vacation, sick leave, or holiday pay do not count toward hours worked when calculating overtime. Overtime is calculated based on the employee's \"regular rate of pay,\" which includes most forms of compensation, not just the hourly wage. Please see Section 3.4.4 for calculating the \"regular rate of pay\".\n\nFor employees who work in locations that are not in California, federal law applies.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Employee Handbook to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 3.4 shall govern meal and rest breaks for covered employees. This policy is intended to comply with the applicable provisions of the California Labor Code, including but not limited to Sections 226.7 and 512. Acme Corp. reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, with or without prior notice, to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n3.4.2. **Meal Breaks:** Except as provided in Section 3.4.4, all non-exempt employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday shall be provided with a meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes. Where an employee works no more than six (6) hours in a workday, the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employee and the employer, provided that the employee receives all compensation for all hours worked during such workday and a written waiver is in place. If an employee's daily shift extends beyond ten (10) hours, a second meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes is required, except where the total hours worked is less than twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was waived. Employees must be completely relieved of all duty during the meal period.

Titan Dynamics is committed to providing advance notice of covered plant closings and mass layoffs to affected employees as required by law, balancing our operational needs with our obligations to our workforce.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notice Requirements in California**\n\nThe California WARN Act imposes specific requirements on employers operating within the state, and these requirements may differ from the federal WARN Act. Therefore, this section applies *exclusively* to employees whose primary work location is in California.\n\n*   **Triggering Events:** A \"mass layoff,\" \"plant closure,\" or \"relocation\" as defined by the California WARN Act may trigger notification requirements. For California purposes, a mass layoff is defined as a reduction in force affecting 50 or more employees within any 30-day period. Further, for purposes of determining WARN Act applicability in California, Titan Dynamics is covered if the Company employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons. Note this employee count applies to all employees of the company, regardless of their location; however, compliance with this policy is triggered only when the layoff occurs in California.\n\n*   **Notification Requirement:** If a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, as defined under California law, affects 50 or more California-based employees within a 30-day period, and Titan Dynamics employs at least 75 individuals, then affected employees must be provided with at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of the event. This notice must adhere to the content requirements specified in the California WARN Act (California Labor Code Sections 1400 et seq.) and be provided to the California Employment Development Department (EDD). If the layoff also constitutes a mass layoff under the federal WARN Act, federal notice requirements must *also* be met concurrently. This policy is to be interpreted according to the provisions of California Labor Code Sections 1400 et seq.\n\n*   **Exceptions:** Exceptions to the notification requirement may apply in certain unforeseen business circumstances, such as a sudden and unexpected cessation of business due to unforeseeable external events. If such exception applies, we will nonetheless provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable.\n\n*   **Employee Obligations:** This policy outlines Titan Dynamics' obligations. There are no explicit obligations placed on individual employees, other than acknowledging receipt of any WARN notice provided, which is required for documentation purposes.

For the purposes of this policy, a \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment or 500 or more employees are affected.\n\nIf Starlight Technologies has fewer than 100 employees company-wide, we are exempt from the WARN Act requirements, and no such advance notice is required. However, Starlight Technologies will still make reasonable efforts to provide as much advance notice as possible when feasible. Furthermore, if a layoff affects less than 50 employees at a single employment site, the 60-day notice requirement does not apply, regardless of the company\u2019s total number of employees.

Rest breaks are considered time worked and shall be compensated at the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Rest breaks are to be taken, where practicable, in the middle of each four-hour work period.\n\n3.4.4. **Waiver:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees may voluntarily waive their meal period in accordance with section 3.4.2 if their work shift does not exceed six (6) hours total work time.

This section outlines the Company's policy regarding leave under the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n4.  08.2 **California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** Pursuant to California Unemployment Insurance Code Sections 3300 et seq., eligible employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) are entitled to Paid Family Leave (PFL). An employee whose location_state is California, who is considered an active employee with an employment_status of 'active', and whose employee.sdi_contributor is \"true\", shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by applicable law. Wage replacement is typically 60-70% of the employee\u2019s wages, subject to the SDI\u2019s maximum weekly benefit amount. This entitlement is separate from and may run concurrently with FMLA leave.\n\n5.  08.3 **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** In compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq., Sterling Consolidated provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during any twelve (12) month period. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Sterling Consolidated for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the leave. Furthermore, employer.employee_count_within_75_miles must be greater than or equal to 50. If the employee meets these conditions, the leave.type requested qualifies under FMLA (family, medical, parental, bonding, caregiver), and leave.duration_weeks does not exceed 12, the employee is eligible for unpaid leave. While on FMLA leave, the employee's health benefits will be maintained under the same terms and conditions as if the employee were actively working.\n\n6.  08.4 **Coordination of Leave:** Sterling Consolidated will coordinate PFL and FMLA leave to the extent required by law. Eligible employees may be able to use PFL to receive partial wage replacement while taking FMLA leave. An employee must follow the Company's established procedures for requesting leave, as detailed in Section 3.05, including providing timely notice of the need for leave and submitting any required documentation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement_percentage\": \"60-70%\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"An employee whose location_state is California, who is considered an active employee with an employment_status of 'active', and whose employee.sdi_contributor is \\\"true\\\", shall be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by applicable law.

For California-based non-exempt employees, overtime will also be paid for any hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday.\n\nThe overtime rate is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay, except as specified below for California employees.\n\n**3.2.2 California Overtime Rules**\n\nCalifornia employees are also entitled to overtime for hours worked over eight (8) in a workday. Additionally, any hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday or for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek are paid at twice (2x) the employee's regular rate of pay. Overtime must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s manager. If a California-based employee refuses to work overtime hours when requested to do so by their manager, it will be considered insubordination and grounds for termination.\n\n**3.2.3 Rest Breaks and Meal Periods**\n\nThis Overtime Compensation policy should be read in conjunction with Skyline Dynamics' Rest Break and Meal Period Policy (Section 3.3), which outlines employee entitlements to rest and meal breaks.\n\n**3.2.4 Record Keeping**\n\nAccurate record keeping of all hours worked is essential to ensure compliance with overtime laws. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their start and end times, as well as any break periods, using the company's timekeeping system.

Human Resources Policy Manual**\n**Section 3.12: Final Paycheck Disbursement (California Employees)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-07-01**\n**Revision: 1.0**\n\nThis policy outlines the procedures for the timely disbursement of final paychecks to employees whose employment with ACME Corp. concludes. This section specifically addresses employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. ACME Corp. is committed to complying with all applicable federal and California state wage and hour laws, including California Labor Code Sections 201, 202, and related provisions.\n\n**3.12.1 Final Paycheck Timing:**\n\nACME Corp. aims to process final paychecks expeditiously. Generally, an employee\u2019s final paycheck, inclusive of all earned but unpaid wages, including accrued and unused vacation time, will be available on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee\u2019s separation date. However, for California employees involuntarily terminated or laid off, and in alignment with current interpretations of California Labor Code Section 201, final paychecks are typically available immediately upon termination. An exception to this general rule is that if the employee's termination occurs outside of normal business hours, or on a day when payroll processing is not available, the final paycheck may be provided no later than the next business day, with provisions made for mailing the check to the employee's last known address if immediate physical handover isn't feasible, provided reasonable attempts to deliver the check in person have been attempted. This exception is contingent on adherence to Section 2.8 concerning notification of a change in employee's address. For employees who voluntarily resign, the timing of the final paycheck depends on the amount of notice given.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.2: Meal and Rest Breaks (California Employees Only)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision: 2.0**\n\nAcme Corp. recognizes the importance of providing employees with adequate meal and rest breaks. This policy applies solely to employees working within the state of California, and it adheres to applicable California Labor Laws. All non-exempt employees are entitled to meal and rest breaks as described below. Note that this policy supersedes any prior policy relating to break times.\n\n*Meal Breaks:* Employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are generally entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. Such meal breaks must commence before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work unless operations require as defined under CA Labor Code Section 512, the only exception being when the shift is no more than six hours, in which case the meal break can be waived by mutual consent between the employee and supervisor. Employees working shifts over ten (10) hours are typically entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break, which must commence before the end of the tenth (10th) hour of work. However, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and employee only if the total hours worked is no more than twelve (12) hours and if the first meal period was not waived. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during meal breaks.\n\n*Rest Breaks:* Non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof, as is standard. Rest breaks should, to the extent possible, be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period. If, because of business necessity, a rest break cannot be provided, the employee may be eligible for a premium payment of one (1) hour of pay for each workday that such violation occurs, contingent on supervisory approval. Contact the HR department for further clarification.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at any time, at the discretion of Acme Corp. management.

This policy outlines our approach to Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). NeoTech Solutions complies with both California state law and federal law regarding family and medical leave. Employees are encouraged to review this policy carefully and contact Human Resources with any questions.\n\n**3.7.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia PFL provides eligible employees with partial wage replacement benefits when they need to take time off work to:\n\n*   Bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement).\n*   Care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling).\n\nPFL benefits are administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Eligible employees may receive up to eight weeks of partial wage replacement, typically 60-70% of their regular wages, depending on their income. Eligibility requirements are set by the EDD and generally require that the employee has paid into California State Disability Insurance (SDI) in the preceding 12 months.\n\n**3.7.3 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including:\n\n*   Birth and care of a newborn child\n*   Placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care\n*   To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\nFMLA eligibility requires that the employee has worked for NeoTech Solutions for at least 12 months, has worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months preceding the leave, and that NeoTech Solutions employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite.\n\n**3.7.4 Interaction of PFL and FMLA**\n\nFor California employees who qualify for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves will run concurrently when the leave reason qualifies under both laws. For example, leave taken for bonding with a new child will qualify as both PFL and FMLA, and the 12-week FMLA entitlement will run at the same time as the 8-week PFL benefit period.\n\n**3.7.5 Termination for Failure to Return from Leave**\n\nIf an employee in California requests Family or Medical leave due to a personal or family medical condition, but the employee's employment status is 'terminated' instead of 'active', then the leave request should be denied. NeoTech Solutions considers this to be a direct violation of company policy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"deny_leave_terminated_employee\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"medical\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee leave request\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee in California requests Family or Medical leave due to a personal or family medical condition, but the employee's employment status is 'terminated' instead of 'active', then the leave request should be denied.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"NeoTech Solutions Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2025-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "termination"}}

This policy outlines the company\u2019s obligations regarding advance notification of workforce reductions.\n\nIn the event of a plant closing or mass layoff, GlobalTech Solutions *will strive* to provide affected employees with a 60-day advance written notice, as mandated by the federal WARN Act *if* the event triggers coverage under said Act. The applicability of WARN is contingent on several factors, including, but not limited to: 1) whether the workforce reduction qualifies as a \"plant closing\" or \"mass layoff\" as defined by the WARN Act, and 2) whether the reduction impacts at least 50 employees at a single site of employment during any 30-day period. More specifically, to trigger the WARN Act for mass layoff scenarios, the 50 employees must constitute at least 33% of the employer's workforce.\n\nNotification will be provided to affected employees, relevant government agencies, and any applicable labor unions. However, this notification requirement is waived if the layoff is due to unforeseen business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required, such as a sudden and unexpected cancellation of a major contract.

Sterling Consolidated is committed to complying with all applicable federal wage and hour laws. This policy does not incorporate any state-specific provisions related to overtime.\n\n4.  4.  2 Eligibility\n\nOvertime compensation is applicable to all non-exempt employees of Sterling Consolidated. Exempt employees, as defined under Section 3.1 of this handbook concerning employee classification, are not eligible for overtime pay. The determination of whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt shall be made in accordance with the FLSA.\n\n5.  4.  3 Overtime Rate and Calculation\n\nPursuant to the FLSA, non-exempt employees shall be compensated for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. For clarity, the regular rate of pay includes all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, the employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this policy, time spent on vacation, sick leave, or other paid time off will not be included when calculating total hours worked for overtime purposes. In determining whether an employee has worked more than forty (40) hours in a workweek, only actual hours worked shall be counted. For instance, if a non-exempt employee works forty-five (45) hours in one workweek, they shall be entitled to five (5) hours of overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay. This overtime pay will be included in the employee\u2019s paycheck for the pay period during which the overtime hours were worked.\n\n6.  4.  4 Timekeeping\n\nAccurate recordkeeping of hours worked is the responsibility of each employee. All non-exempt employees must accurately record their start and stop times, as well as any break periods, on their timesheets. Falsification of time records may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n7.  4.  5 Policy Changes\n\nSterling Consolidated reserves the right to modify or terminate this policy at any time, with or without notice, as required by business needs or changes in applicable law.

This policy applies to all non-exempt employees. Employees are required to accurately record their meal and rest breaks in the Company\u2019s timekeeping system. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n4.  4.  2.  **California Employees.** Notwithstanding Section 3.4.1, for employees working in California, the following rules shall apply pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512. Employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. A second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break shall be provided to employees working shifts exceeding ten (10) hours. In addition to meal breaks, California employees shall receive a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. If an employee's employment status is active and that employee\u2019s location is within the State of California, and the employee is deemed to be non-exempt, and furthermore, if the employee\u2019s shift length is greater than 5 hours, the employee must be provided with a meal break; failure to provide such a break will result in potential penalties and disciplinary action. Moreover, failure to provide the required meal or rest periods in California, or failure to properly record such breaks, may lead to immediate termination.\n\n5.  4.  3.  **Employees Outside of California.** For employees working outside of California, Apex Industries, Inc. will comply with all applicable state and federal laws, if any, regarding meal and rest periods.

This policy outlines the company's approach to meal and rest breaks for its employees. Please note that the application of this policy may vary based on an employee\u2019s location and employment classification.\n\n**3.2.1 General Guidelines**\n\nFederal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, Sterling Consolidated, to promote employee well-being, provides breaks in accordance with state law where applicable. For employees not covered by specific state laws regarding breaks (e.g., states other than California), the provision of breaks is at the discretion of the employee's manager, keeping in mind business needs. Any breaks less than 20 minutes provided under federal law are considered work time.\n\n**3.2.2 California-Specific Regulations**\n\nEmployees working in California are entitled to certain meal and rest breaks as mandated by California law. Specifically, non-exempt employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday are generally entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. If you work over 10 hours in a workday, you are entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. However, under certain circumstances, as described in section 3.2.5, if the total hours worked are no more than six hours the meal period may be waived by mutual consent. Non-exempt employees working in California must take a ten (10) minute paid rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. If an employee is unable to take a mandated meal or rest break due to business necessity, they should immediately notify their manager. If California state law applies, the company shall pay an employee one hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal or rest period is not provided.\n\n**3.2.3 Break Timing**\n\nMeal breaks should ideally be scheduled near the middle of the shift, whenever reasonably possible. Rest breaks should also be evenly distributed throughout the work period. Section 8.1 outlines the procedure for employees requesting a different break schedule.\n\n**3.2.4 Record Keeping**\n\nEmployees are responsible for accurately recording their break times in the company\u2019s timekeeping system (see Section 9.4: Timekeeping). Failure to accurately record breaks may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n**3.2.5 Meal Period Waiver**\nThe meal period requirement may be waived by the employee when the total hours worked in the shift are less than or equal to six (6) hours."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_break_waiver_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"shift.duration_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"waiver of meal period requirement\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, under certain circumstances, as described in section 3.2.5, if the total hours worked are no more than six hours the meal period may be waived by mutual consent. \",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Sterling Consolidated HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "leave"}}

We are committed to complying with all applicable federal and state laws. Please note that break policies can vary significantly based on location. All employees are responsible for understanding the policies applicable to their worksite. This policy is intended to provide clarity and consistency across all locations where Acme Corp operates.\n\n**3.2.1 General Break Policy**\n\nFederal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Acme Corp provides short breaks (typically lasting 5 to 20 minutes), employees must be paid for that time. Longer meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) are unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities.\n\n**3.2.2 California-Specific Break Policy**\n\nFor employees working in California, the following rules apply due to California state law, regardless of federal law:\n\n*   **Meal Breaks:** Non-exempt employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. These meal breaks must begin before the end of the fifth hour and tenth hour of work, respectively. Employees must be relieved of all duties during their meal break. If a meal break is not provided in accordance with California law, employees will be paid one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal break is not provided.\n\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Non-exempt employees are entitled to a ten (10) minute paid rest break for every four (4) hours worked (or major fraction thereof). To clarify, if a non-exempt employee works a 6 hour shift, they will receive one rest break. If that same employee were to work an 8 hour shift, they would be entitled to two rest breaks.\n\n**3.2.3 Policy Enforcement**\n\nAcme Corp supervisors and managers are responsible for ensuring that all employees receive the meal and rest breaks to which they are entitled.

All non-exempt employees working in California are eligible for overtime pay as described below. This policy supplements Section 3.2.1 (Regular Hours and Pay) of this handbook.\n\nEmployees who work more than eight (8) hours in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek are entitled to overtime compensation. For hours exceeding eight (8) hours in a workday, or up to forty (40) in a workweek, overtime will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. However, should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they will be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond the initial twelve. Furthermore, employees who work more than eight (8) hours on their seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek shall also receive compensation at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding eight on the seventh day, provided such work is pre-approved by the employee's manager and documented properly in the employee's timesheet, in accordance with policy 3.5.2 (Timekeeping Procedures). Any hours worked exceeding forty in a week are calculated independently of the daily overtime calculations; therefore, overtime will only be paid once for each hour worked and the higher overtime rate will take precedence in cases where the employee qualifies for overtime under both daily and weekly calculations. For the avoidance of doubt, federal overtime provisions also apply; however, Veridian Dynamics will follow California state law in all cases where California law provides for a greater overtime benefit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_daily_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For hours exceeding eight (8) hours in a workday, or up to forty (40) in a workweek, overtime will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_daily_2x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 2\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"should an employee work more than twelve (12) hours in a single workday, they will be compensated at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked beyond the initial twelve.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_weekly_15x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who work more than eight (8) hours in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek are entitled to overtime compensation.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_7th_day_2x\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.consecutive_workdays\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 2x regular rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"rate_multiplier\": 2\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Furthermore, employees who work more than eight (8) hours on their seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek shall also receive compensation at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding eight on the seventh day\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Overtime Compensation (California Employees)\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "overtime", "rule_type": "compensation"}}

As outlined in Section 1.2 (Employee Classifications), non-exempt employees are those who are eligible to receive overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws.\n\n**3.4.2 Overtime Compensation Standards**\n\nOvertime will be paid in accordance with federal and state laws, whichever provides the greater benefit to the employee.\n\n*   **Federal Law:** Under the FLSA, overtime is required for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime rate is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.\n*   **California Law:** In California, overtime is required for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, and for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime rate is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.

Employees who work unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, especially if employee's location is in California and the employee's pay type is salaried, unless specifically authorized by the supervisor. This termination action will only be carried out if all previous warnings were recorded.\n\n**3.4.4 Recordkeeping**\n\nAccurate recordkeeping of hours worked is essential for proper overtime calculation. All non-exempt employees are required to accurately record their start and stop times, as well as any meal breaks taken, using the company\u2019s timekeeping system. Any falsification of time records will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Note that while Acme Corp. strives to create a positive and productive work environment, the provisions of this policy shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with federal standards only. This policy is effective as of January 1, 2025, and supersedes all prior policies regarding meal and rest breaks.

However, if an employee voluntarily takes a meal break of thirty (30) minutes or more, they must be fully relieved of all job duties during that period. Such a meal break shall be unpaid. An employee's decision to waive their meal break does not create an obligation for Acme Corp. to provide any compensation in lieu of the break, nor does it expose the company to any penalty. Employees who work shifts lasting eight (8) hours or more are encouraged to take a meal break in order to maintain optimal productivity.\n\n**3.5.3 Rest Breaks:** Similarly, federal law does not mandate rest breaks for adult employees. However, should Acme Corp. elect to provide rest breaks lasting five (5) to twenty (20) minutes, any such rest breaks shall be considered time worked and shall be fully compensated. The scheduling of any voluntary rest breaks is subject to the operational needs of the company and the discretion of the employee's supervisor.

Acme Corp strives to comply with both federal and applicable state laws regarding final pay.\n\n**3.2.1 Timing of Final Paycheck:**\n\nThe timing of your final paycheck depends on the reason for your separation (termination, resignation, or layoff) and where you work. Federal law requires that a final paycheck be issued by the next regularly scheduled payday. However, some states, like California, have stricter requirements.\n\nFor employees working in California, the following rules apply:\n\n*   **Involuntary Termination:** If you are terminated by Acme Corp (e.g., laid off, fired), your final paycheck, including all earned wages and accrued, unused vacation time, will be available to you immediately upon termination. (California Labor Code Section 201)\n\n*   **Voluntary Resignation with Notice:** If you resign from Acme Corp and provide at least 72 hours' advance notice of your resignation, your final paycheck will be available to you on your last day of employment.\n\n*   **Voluntary Resignation without Notice:** If you resign from Acme Corp without providing at least 72 hours' advance notice, your final paycheck will be available to you within 72 hours of your last day of employment.\n\nFor employees working outside of California, Acme Corp will provide your final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following your last day of employment, in accordance with federal law.

Human Resources Policy Manual**\n**Section 3.14: Final Paycheck Disbursement**\n**Revision Number:** 2.0\n**Effective Date:** 2024-07-01\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to complying with all applicable state and federal wage and hour laws regarding the timely disbursement of final paychecks. This policy applies to all employees of Acme Corp. regardless of their location within the United States, though specific state laws may govern in certain situations as outlined below.\n\nGenerally, federal law requires that final paychecks be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following an employee's termination of employment. However, for employees working in California, California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 impose stricter requirements in cases of termination. Specifically, if an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp., their final paycheck, including all wages earned and accrued vacation time, will be provided to them immediately at the time of termination. For employees who voluntarily resign their position with at least 72 hours prior notice, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. Employees who voluntarily terminate without providing at least 72 hours prior notice will receive their final paycheck no later than 72 hours after their last day of work, excluding weekends and holidays, to allow for payroll processing. The 72-hour period starts at the time the employee notifies Acme Corp. of their resignation.\n\nIf, however, circumstances arise in California where adherence to this 72-hour rule is administratively infeasible, such as a mass layoff (see Policy 3.17: Workforce Reductions) or plant closure, Acme Corp. will make every reasonable effort to comply while understanding potential minor delays might occur. In all other states where Acme Corp. operates, employees will receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination of employment. In cases of involuntary termination, HR will attempt to expedite this process where possible, though federal law does not mandate an immediate timeframe.\n\nAny questions regarding final paycheck disbursement should be directed to the Human Resources Department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_involuntary\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck, including all wages earned and accrued vacation time\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, if an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp., their final paycheck, including all wages earned and accrued vacation time, will be provided to them immediately at the time of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_voluntary_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees who voluntarily resign their position with at least 72 hours prior notice, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_voluntary_no_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"voluntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who voluntarily terminate without providing at least 72 hours prior notice will receive their final paycheck no later than 72 hours after their last day of work, excluding weekends and holidays, to allow for payroll processing.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_non_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In all other states where Acme Corp. operates, employees will receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This policy outlines our guidelines for meal and rest breaks for all employees.\n\nAll non-exempt employees are eligible for rest periods and meal periods in compliance with Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA) guidelines. While federal law doesn't mandate meal or rest breaks, if Acme Corp. chooses to provide short breaks (typically lasting 5 to 20 minutes), these breaks will be considered compensable time. Employees are not required to remain on company property during short breaks, but are expected to be available via company provided communication methods, such as cell phones or email, to handle urgent business needs.\n\nLonger meal periods, typically thirty (30) minutes or more, may be unpaid, provided that the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities during the meal period. However, if an employee is required to perform any work, even intermittently, during their designated meal period, the entire meal period must be considered paid working time. This rule applies regardless of whether the employee's daily or weekly hours have already triggered overtime compensation.\n\nFurther, as a condition of employment, it is expected that all non-exempt employees will record all breaks accurately and honestly using the company's timekeeping system. Any falsification of break records may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. For employees working remotely, the same rules apply and all breaks must be accurately recorded.

This policy outlines our responsibilities under the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the Federal WARN Act. These laws require us to provide advance notice in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that affects a certain number of employees.\n\n**California WARN Act:** This law applies if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees in California. A \u201cmass layoff\u201d under California law is defined as a layoff affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. Therefore, if Acme Corp has 75 or more employees in California and a planned layoff will affect 50 or more employees within a 30-day period at a single site of employment, we are required to provide affected employees with at least 60 days' advance written notice of their termination. This notice will include information about the layoff, affected positions, expected termination dates, and available resources.\n\n**Federal WARN Act:** The federal WARN Act has a slightly higher threshold. It applies if Acme Corp has 100 or more employees company-wide.

An employee who does not contribute to SDI is not eligible for paid leave under this provision. However, if an employee is instead requesting an FMLA leave, they are eligible for leave if the employer has at least 50 employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite. In order to qualify for FMLA leave, employees must have been employed for at least twelve months by OptiCorp, and worked at least 1250 hours in the 12-month period preceding the leave. All OptiCorp employees, except those with *terminated* employment_status are generally expected to comply with company regulations during periods of FMLA leave, regardless of whether such leave is ultimately unpaid or runs concurrently with PFL, barring specific written accommodation approved by Human Resources, which may be granted contingent upon the specific circumstances surrounding the leave request and the employee's professional obligations.\n\nThe availability of PFL benefits is subject to the employee\u2019s continued contribution to the SDI program through payroll deductions, so any period during which contribution ceases, for any reason, will impact eligibility. Note also that while FMLA provides job protection, it is generally unpaid unless running concurrently with PFL or other employer provided paid leave.

This section outlines our policies related to Family and Medical Leave for California-based employees. These policies are intended to comply with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL) laws, but may be interpreted independently.\n\n**3.4.1 Leave Entitlements**\n\nEligible California employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are entitled to participate in California's Paid Family Leave (PFL) program. If an employee has worked for Acme Corp. for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months preceding the leave, they may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Note that FMLA leave is unpaid. However, in accordance with California PFL guidelines, employees who are taking leave to bond with a new child, or to care for a seriously ill family member (as defined by the PFL law), may be eligible to receive partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks of leave, usually around 60-70% of their regular earnings, paid through the state. If an employee qualifies for both PFL and FMLA, the leaves will run concurrently. For example, if an eligible employee takes eight weeks of PFL, this will also count as eight weeks of their FMLA entitlement, leaving four weeks of unpaid FMLA leave. Employees should apply directly to the Employment Development Department (EDD) for PFL benefits. Approval for PFL benefits is determined solely by the EDD. If an employee does not contribute to California SDI, they are not eligible for California PFL even if they qualify for FMLA. Contact Human Resources for assistance in determining your eligibility and to request the necessary paperwork.

Compensation for hours worked over twelve (12) in a single workday will be two (2) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for California employees. Further, for those California employees, if an employee works more than eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive day in a workweek, those hours will be paid at two (2) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. Note that for the purposes of this policy, a \"workweek\" is defined as Sunday 12:00 AM to Saturday 11:59 PM. The calculation of the \u201cregular rate of pay\u201d will include all non-discretionary bonuses and other incentive compensation as required by applicable law.

This policy outlines the eligibility requirements, duration, and coordination of these leave types. The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, as defined by federal law.

Eligibility for California PFL requires that the employee contributes to California State Disability Insurance (SDI).

Generally, non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. For employees physically working in California, overtime is paid at one and one-half times (1.5x) their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday or forty (40) in a workweek. Now, if those employees continue their dedicated effort beyond 12 hours in a single day (assuming their employment status is still active), they might be compensated at twice (2x) their regular rate for those extended hours, but we generally prefer to avoid such long shifts, as addressed in policy 3.11 on employee wellbeing.\n\nHowever, federal law differs; overtime for non-exempt employees is only calculated for hours worked over 40 in a workweek, irrespective of daily hours, and provided their employment status hasn't changed (e.g. termination). So, for employees working outside of California, or whose employment is governed solely by federal law, overtime is calculated according to the FLSA. If a California-based employee works more than 8 hours on their seventh consecutive day in a workweek, they will also be paid at twice (2x) their regular rate, provided that their hours_worked_weekly is less than 60.\n\nFinally, to reiterate what's covered in Policy 2.1, any employee whose employment_status is not 'active' (e.g. 'terminated', 'resigned', 'laid_off') is not eligible for overtime pay, regardless of hours worked, or whether they're in California or another state.

Furthermore, non-exempt employees are entitled to double their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday, or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek. For example, if a non-exempt employee works ten hours in a single day, they will receive their regular rate of pay for the first eight hours and overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for the remaining two hours. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked and to immediately notify their supervisor of any overtime hours worked that have not been properly compensated.

This policy is intended to comply with California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202, as interpreted by applicable case law. While federal law may allow for payment on the next regular payday, in cases of conflict, California law takes precedence for California employees.\n\n**3.15.2 Involuntary Termination:** In the event of an involuntary termination of employment (including, but not limited to, layoff or termination for cause), all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination shall be due and payable immediately at the time of termination. This is subject to the condition that Human Resources has received all company property including but not limited to access badges and laptop computers. The company reserves the right to make deductions as permitted by law.\n\n**3.15.3 Voluntary Resignation:** For employees who voluntarily resign their employment, the timing of the final paycheck distribution depends on the amount of notice provided. If an employee provides at least seventy-two (72) hours' advance notice of their resignation, the final paycheck, reflecting all wages earned, shall be due and payable on the employee's last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns without providing at least seventy-two (72) hours' advance notice, the final paycheck shall be available within seventy-two (72) hours of the employee's last day of work. In situations where the employee's last paycheck cannot be directly delivered (for example, because the employee did not provide forwarding information), the final paycheck will be mailed to the employee's last known address. If the employee also works in another state, federal law shall govern that portion of the wages associated with work performed outside California.\n\n**3.15.4 Definition of \"Wages\":** For the purposes of this policy, \"wages\" shall be defined as all amounts for labor performed by employees of Acme Corp., whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time, task, piece, commission basis, or other method of calculation.

This policy outlines the company's approach to plant closings, mass layoffs, and relocations within the State of California, and is intended to adhere to both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the California WARN Act. This policy applies exclusively to employees whose primary work location is within California.\n\nGenerally, if Acme Corp plans a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation as defined below impacting California employees, the company will provide affected employees with at least 60 days' advance written notice of termination. A \u201cmass layoff\u201d is defined as a reduction in force, impacting at least 50 employees within a 30-day period, at a single site of employment. The number of impacted employees is determined based on the number of California-based employees affected, and is irrespective of the total number of Acme Corp employees nationwide. A \u201cplant closing\u201d refers to the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. However, the California WARN Act applies if Acme Corp employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons. For the purposes of this policy, a \u201crelocation\u201d is defined as the removal of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations of an employer to a different location 100 miles or more away. In cases where a layoff affects fewer than 50 California employees, or if the company employs fewer than 75 individuals in California, this policy regarding advance notice will not apply, unless otherwise required by other company policies or applicable laws. While Acme Corp will make its best effort to comply, unforeseen business circumstances may preclude providing the full 60-day notice, in which case Acme Corp will comply with applicable regulations regarding payments in lieu of notice."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\",\n            \"relocation\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Generally, if Acme Corp plans a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation as defined below impacting California employees, the company will provide affected employees with at least 60 days' advance written notice of termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance notice of termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In cases where a layoff affects fewer than 50 California employees, or if the company employs fewer than 75 individuals in California, this policy regarding advance notice will not apply, unless otherwise required by other company policies or applicable laws.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance notice of termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In cases where a layoff affects fewer than 50 California employees, or if the company employs fewer than 75 individuals in California, this policy regarding advance notice will not apply, unless otherwise required by other company policies or applicable laws.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "leave"}}

If an employee is involuntarily terminated, meaning Acme Co. is ending the employment relationship, then the employee's final paycheck, including all accrued but unused vacation time (See Section 4.1.2 for accrual rates) and any other compensation due, will be made available on their date of termination unless operational constraints make it impractical.\n\nIf, however, an employee voluntarily resigns, the timing of the final paycheck is contingent upon how much advance notice the employee provides to their supervisor. Acme Co. strongly encourages employees to provide at least two weeks' notice; as specified in policy 6.3 relating to resignation procedures. If an employee provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. If an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours' advance notice, their final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day of employment.

FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for qualifying reasons, as defined by the FMLA statute.\n\nTo be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Veridian Dynamics for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. If an employee meets the 12-month tenure requirement, but works less than 30 hours per week on average, then the employee is not eligible for FMLA leave unless Veridian Dynamics employs more than 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Under these conditions, eligible employees may use FMLA for their own serious health condition or to care for a qualifying family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition, or for the birth or adoption of a child. Employees should submit a written request for FMLA leave to their supervisor and the HR department, as outlined in Section 3.15, \"Leave Request Procedures.\" Failure to comply with these procedures may impact approval of the leave. For questions about your eligibility or the FMLA leave process, please contact the HR department.\n\nVeridian Dynamics will maintain an employee\u2019s health insurance benefits during FMLA leave under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had continued to work. Upon return from FMLA leave, employees are generally entitled to be restored to their original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid, job-protected leave under FMLA\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"leave_duration_weeks\": 12,\n          \"pay_status\": \"unpaid\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Veridian Dynamics for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave.

HR Policy Manual**\n**Section 3.12: Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance**\n**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01\n**Revision:** 2.0\n\nApex Solutions, Inc. is committed to treating all employees with fairness and respect. In the event of a workforce reduction, we strive to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act.\n\n**WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nThe WARN Act requires employers to provide advance notice to employees in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff. A *plant closing* is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A *mass layoff* is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees, if these 50 or more employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees are affected, regardless of the percentage of the workforce they represent.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, a *mass layoff* also includes reductions in force that occur over a 90-day period, if not planned and announced together. We will treat these reductions as a single *mass layoff* event, per federal regulations. In all cases, we require 60 days advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff.\n\nCalifornia has its own WARN Act requirements, and because we employ individuals in California, we must also abide by these regulations. Under California law, the threshold for triggering WARN Act requirements is lower; the law applies if there is a mass layoff, relocation, or termination of a covered establishment that employs 75 or more people within the preceding 12 months and affects 50 or more employees. If layoffs affect 50 or more employees in California, but the company-wide total is less than 100 employees, then the California WARN requirements apply, but the federal WARN requirements do not.

Please consult Section 3.2.1 for detailed eligibility requirements. FMLA provides up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (as defined by FMLA), or for the employee's own serious health condition.\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL), administered through the State Disability Insurance (SDI) program, may run concurrently with FMLA. Therefore, employees eligible for and approved to receive PFL benefits may receive partial wage replacement, typically 60-70% of their usual wages, for up to eight (8) weeks during their leave. To be eligible for PFL, employees must be SDI contributors. Employees whose primary work location is outside of California are not eligible for California PFL, even if the employee resides in California. Note that FMLA leave is unpaid, however, the use of accrued vacation, sick leave, or other paid time off may be permitted to supplement FMLA leave as outlined in Section 4.5.\n\nIn cases where an employee uses PFL for bonding with a new child, the leave must typically be taken within one year of the child's birth or placement.

A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33% of the employees (excluding any part-time employees) at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees (excluding any part-time employees).\n\nIf Acme Corp has 100 or more employees company-wide (full-time and part-time), and a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees is planned, a WARN notice must be provided to affected employees, the state dislocated worker unit, and the chief elected official of the local government. Acme will determine the number of affected employees based on the total anticipated terminations over a 30-day timeframe (layoff.timeframe_days). If the layoff.affected_employee_count is below 50, no WARN notice is required under this policy.

These benefits may provide partial wage replacement, currently at approximately 60-70% of your usual wages, for up to eight (8) weeks for qualifying events. These qualifying events are for the purpose of bonding with a new child (within one year of birth or placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law.\n\nTo be eligible for PFL benefits, if you have been employed with Veridian Dynamics for less than twelve (12) months, or worked less than 1,250 hours in the twelve (12) months prior to your leave start date, then you will need to first utilize any available accrued vacation time before being able to begin to receive PFL benefits.

(\"the Company\") is committed to complying with both the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq., and the California Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3300 et seq., to provide eligible employees with job-protected leave for qualifying family and medical reasons. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to provide greater benefits than those provided under applicable law.\n\n3.12.2. **Eligibility Requirements.** To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, and be employed at a worksite where the Company employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for California-based employees who contribute to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) fund, eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits shall be governed by applicable California law. An employee's SDI contribution status, as recorded in the Company's payroll system, shall be the determining factor in PFL eligibility. Paid family leave under California law, Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3300 et seq., is restricted to family leave as defined under that law, and will not be granted for any medical leave of the employee, even if such leave may be covered under FMLA. FMLA shall govern an employee\u2019s medical leave.\n\n3.12.3. **Leave Entitlement.** Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under FMLA during any 12-month period. Employees eligible for California Paid Family Leave may also receive partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member, provided the employee contributes to SDI. The duration of paid leave under CA PFL is separate from, and does not extend, the 12-week unpaid leave entitlement provided under FMLA.\n\n3.12.4. **Concurrent Leave.** Where an employee qualifies for both FMLA and California Paid Family Leave, the leaves shall run concurrently to the extent permitted by law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave, and be employed at a worksite where the Company employs at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, for California-based employees who contribute to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) fund, eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits shall be governed by applicable California law.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_leave_restriction_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"medical\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Paid family leave under California law, Cal.

These provisions are intended to comply with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, and applicable Wage Orders issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission.\n\n3.4.2. **Meal Breaks:** Pursuant to California law, all non-exempt employees are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break when their shift exceeds five (5) hours. The meal break shall commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. Further, employees working a shift exceeding ten (10) hours are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, which shall commence no later than the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work.

If an employee fails to take a properly authorized and timed meal break, they may be eligible for one (1) hour of premium pay per missed meal break as required by California law.\n\n3.4.3. **Rest Breaks:** Non-exempt California employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks shall, insofar as practicable, be taken in the middle of each four (4) hour work period.

This policy outlines the provisions for Family and Medical Leave in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. Eligibility for FMLA leave is determined by federal regulations, specifically those outlined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611, et seq., and 29 CFR Part 825, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**3.4.1 FMLA Leave Provisions**\n\nSubject to the eligibility requirements outlined below and provided that the employee has already used any available paid leave under Section 3.3, an eligible employee of Acme Corp. will be granted up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following reasons:\n\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth;\n*   The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement;\n*   To care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\nEligibility for FMLA leave is contingent upon an employee having been employed by Acme Corp. for at least 12 months and having worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. Furthermore, FMLA leave is only available if Acme Corp. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Requests for leave exceeding 12 weeks may be considered under Section 3.5: Extended Leave, but such leave will be at the discretion of the company and subject to business needs.

This policy outlines the circumstances under which employees are eligible for overtime pay.\n\n**Eligibility:**\nThis policy applies to all non-exempt employees of Sterling Dynamics, Inc., as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. Overtime compensation is governed by both federal and state regulations, and the more generous standard will always apply. See Section 3.1, Employee Classification, for information on determining exempt vs. non-exempt status.\n\n**Overtime Calculation:**\nGenerally, overtime is calculated as one and one-half (1.5) times an employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. For employees located in California, overtime is also calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday. Therefore, if an employee works in California and their employee.hours_worked_daily is less than 8, and their employee.hours_worked_weekly is greater than 40, they will be paid 1.5x their regular hourly rate for those hours exceeding 40. Any hours worked exceeding both the daily and weekly thresholds will only be subject to 1.5x overtime once.\n\n**Overtime Authorization:**\nAll overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor. Unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n**Seventh Day Overtime (California):** Employees in California are entitled to overtime compensation at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. Any hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek will be compensated at two (2) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.\n\n**Rest Breaks and Meal Periods:**\nEmployees are entitled to rest breaks and meal periods as required by applicable state and federal law. These breaks are typically unpaid, except when short rest breaks are required by law. See Section 3.3, Rest and Meal Breaks, for details.\n\n**Recordkeeping:**\nSterling Dynamics, Inc. maintains accurate records of all hours worked by non-exempt employees. Employees are responsible for accurately reporting their time worked on their timesheets.

Exempt employees who are involuntarily terminated will receive their final paycheck no later than the next regularly scheduled pay date, as provided under federal law. Any dispute regarding the nature of the termination (voluntary vs. involuntary) will be governed by the procedures outlined in Section 7.05.\n\n**3.12.3 California Employees \u2013 Voluntary Termination.** Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 202, if an employee voluntarily resigns and provides at least 72 hours' notice of their intent to resign, the final paycheck shall be made available to the employee on their last day of employment. However, if the employee fails to provide at least 72 hours' notice, the final paycheck shall be made available within 72 hours of the employee's last day of employment.

It is the policy of Sterling Consolidated to provide as much advance notice as reasonably possible to affected employees in the event of a workforce reduction. All workforce reduction decisions must be reviewed by the Legal Department and Human Resources to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. This policy applies to all Sterling Consolidated employees across all locations, including California.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Applicability**\n\nSterling Consolidated adheres to both the federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.) and any applicable state WARN Acts, including the California WARN Act (California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1408). Where the federal and state laws differ, Sterling Consolidated will comply with the more stringent requirements. Specifically, in California, employers with 75 or more employees are subject to the California WARN Act. Therefore, if Sterling Consolidated initiates a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that affects 50 or more employees within California, the company is required to provide 60 days\u2019 advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government representatives. The definition of \"employee\" for this purpose includes full-time and part-time employees, but does not include employees who have worked less than 6 months in the aggregate in the preceding 12 months or employees who work an average of fewer than 20 hours per week. See Section 1.05 for definitions.\n\n**3.12.2 Notification Requirements**\n\nIn the event of a covered mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, Sterling Consolidated will provide written notice to:\n\n*   All affected employees.\n*   The California Employment Development Department (EDD), if the affected employees are in California.\n*   The chief elected official of the local government.\n\nThe notice will contain all information required by the WARN Act, including the date of the planned action, the expected duration of any temporary layoff, and contact information for company representatives.\n\n**3.12.3 Exceptions**\n\nCertain exceptions to the WARN Act notification requirements may apply, such as unforeseen business circumstances or natural disasters.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, this policy shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, and applicable Wage Orders issued by the Industrial Welfare Commission. This policy supersedes any prior policy or practice concerning meal and rest breaks for California non-exempt employees.\n\n3.2.2. **Meal Breaks:** Pursuant to California law, all non-exempt employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted meal period. Such meal period shall commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. Employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute meal period, which shall commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work. However, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employee and the employer if the total hours worked in the workday do not exceed twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived. The company shall require employees to record their meal break start and stop times accurately. If an employee fails to take a legally compliant meal break, as defined above, Apex Solutions, Inc. shall provide one (1) hour of premium pay to the employee for each workday that a meal period is not provided. Employees classified as exempt are not subject to this policy.\n\n3.2.3. **Rest Breaks:** All non-exempt employees shall be provided with a paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest periods should, if practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. Employees are not required to remain on company premises during rest breaks, but must be available to return to work at the conclusion of the rest period. Failure to provide a compliant rest break will result in the payment of one (1) hour of premium pay to the employee for each workday that a rest period is not provided.\n\n3.2.4. **Waivers:** Employees in the following roles are not eligible to waive meal breaks: Customer Service Representative, Data Entry Clerk, and Junior Accountant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"30-minute uninterrupted meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California law, all non-exempt employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted meal period.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"second_meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"second thirty (30) minute meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute meal period, which shall commence no later than the end of the employee\\u2019s tenth (10th) hour of work.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"rest_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"All non-exempt employees shall be provided with a paid ten (10) minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_waiver_restriction_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"Customer Service Representative\",\n            \"Data Entry Clerk\",\n            \"Junior Accountant\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"second meal period waiver, with employee consent, for shifts <=12 hours\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employee and the employer if the total hours worked in the workday do not exceed twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

Please refer to Policy 1.1.2 \"Employee Definitions\" for clarification on employment classifications.\n\nGenerally, final paychecks will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's last day of work. However, specific regulations apply to employees working in California. For employees whose primary work location is in California, the following rules apply: If an employee is involuntarily terminated, their final paycheck, including all earned wages and accrued, unused vacation time (see Policy 3.3.1 \"Vacation Accrual and Use\") will be available immediately upon termination. If the employee voluntarily resigns and provides at least 72 hours\u2019 notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours\u2019 notice, their final paycheck will be available no later than 72 hours after their last day of employment, excluding weekends and holidays. Note, that this 72-hour rule does not apply in cases where the final wages are less than $100, in such cases, the employee should have access to that payment within two weeks of last date of employment, regardless of resignation notice.

Therefore, we are committed to providing as much advance notice as possible.\n\n**WARN Act Notification:**\n\nUnder the Federal WARN Act, Sterling Consolidated must provide 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment if we employ 100 or more employees company-wide.

The notice will include information about the expected date of separation, any applicable benefits continuation options, and available resources for job placement assistance.\n\n**Compliance Decision Rule**\n\nSpecifically, if Sterling Consolidated employs 75 or more employees company-wide (employer.employee_count gte 75) and is planning a mass layoff impacting 50 or more employees within a 30-day timeframe (layoff.affected_employee_count gte 50 AND layoff.timeframe_days lte 30 AND layoff.type eq mass_layoff) where the affected employees work in California (employee.location_state eq CA), then we are required to provide 60 calendar days advance written notice to those employees, the CA EDD, and local government officials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_california_compliance\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"mass_layoff\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees, California EDD, and local government officials\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, if Sterling Consolidated employs 75 or more employees company-wide (employer.employee_count gte 75) and is planning a mass layoff impacting 50 or more employees within a 30-day timeframe (layoff.affected_employee_count gte 50 AND layoff.timeframe_days lte 30 AND layoff.type eq mass_layoff) where the affected employees work in California (employee.location_state eq CA), then we are required to provide 60 calendar days advance written notice to those employees, the CA EDD, and local government officials.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

This policy outlines the eligibility requirements and benefits available under each program, with specific considerations for California-based employees.\n\n**Federal FMLA Leave:** Eligible employees, as defined by federal law, are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during any 12-month period for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (as defined under the FMLA), or for the employee's own serious health condition. To be eligible, an employee must have worked for Acme Corp. for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. Furthermore, FMLA only applies if Acme Corp. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee\u2019s worksite.\n\n**California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** California employees who contribute to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) fund may be eligible for PFL benefits. PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits, typically 60-70% of your regular wages, for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member or to bond with a new child. An employee's eligibility for SDI contributions is determined by the State of California. While FMLA provides job protection, PFL does not automatically guarantee job reinstatement, but job protection often exists while on PFL through the federal FMLA provision. Leave runs concurrently where both FMLA and PFL overlap. Employees must follow all Acme Corp. attendance policies and procedures while on any leave of absence.

This policy outlines the provisions for both FMLA and PFL, specifically for employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. Please note that while both programs address family and medical leave, their eligibility requirements, leave durations, and compensation structures differ.\n\n**6.2.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible California employees, as defined by the FMLA statute, are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during any 12-month period for qualifying reasons, including the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child; to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Sterling Consolidated for at least 12 months, and have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave. Additionally, Sterling Consolidated must employ at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee\u2019s worksite for the employee to qualify for FMLA.\n\n**6.2.3 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner) or to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) within one year of the child\u2019s birth or placement. Benefits are typically 60-70% of the employee\u2019s usual earnings, subject to SDI contribution levels. It is important to note that while FMLA provides job protection, PFL is primarily a wage replacement program and does not guarantee job reinstatement on its own. An employee may be eligible for both FMLA and PFL concurrently if they meet the eligibility requirements for both programs. Employees are encouraged to review Section 6.5 for interaction with other leaves.

Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1408). These laws are designed to provide employees and communities time to prepare for potential job loss. The specific requirements differ slightly between the federal and California laws, as outlined below:\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act:** Requires employers with 100 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) to provide 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment during any 30-day period.\n*   **California WARN Act:** Extends this protection to employers with 75 or more employees (full and part-time) and lowers the threshold for a mass layoff to 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. In addition, the California WARN act applies if the employer relocates its operations, such that 100 or more employees lose their jobs.\n\n**3.12.2 Compliance Procedures**\n\nGoldenGate Technologies is dedicated to adhering to the stricter requirements of either the federal or California WARN Act, depending on the employee's location_state and the total number of employees affected. To ensure compliance, the HR department will notify the appropriate agencies and affected employees when a mass layoff is planned. Specifically, if GoldenGate Technologies' employer.employee_count_within_75_miles is greater than or equal to 75, and layoff.affected_employee_count is not less than 50, and employee.location_state is not_in [\"AK\", \"DE\", \"MT\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"VT\", \"WY\"], then the HR department must provide a 60-day advance written notice to the affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and any applicable local government.\n\n**3.12.3 Exceptions**\n\n[Section intentionally omitted for brevity]\n\n**3.12.4 Employee Rights**\n\n[Section intentionally omitted for brevity]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"AK\",\n            \"DE\",\n            \"MT\",\n            \"ND\",\n            \"SD\",\n            \"VT\",\n            \"WY\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and any applicable local government\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, if GoldenGate Technologies' employer.employee_count_within_75_miles is greater than or equal to 75, and layoff.affected_employee_count is not less than 50, and employee.location_state is not_in [\\\"AK\\\", \\\"DE\\\", \\\"MT\\\", \\\"ND\\\", \\\"SD\\\", \\\"VT\\\", \\\"WY\\\"], then the HR department must provide a 60-day advance written notice to the affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and any applicable local government.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "leave"}}

This policy applies to all active employees of Acme Corp, regardless of employment status, across all locations where Acme Corp operates, with certain location-specific modifications as detailed below.\n\n*   **General Guidelines:** All non-exempt employees are entitled to rest and meal breaks during their workdays. Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees; however, if breaks lasting between 5 and 20 minutes are provided, they must be paid. Bona fide meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) need not be compensated when the employee is completely relieved of all duties.\n\n*   **California-Specific Provisions:** Employees whose primary work location is in California have additional rights and responsibilities concerning meal and rest breaks, as mandated by California law. Specifically, a 30-minute unpaid meal period is required for any employee working more than five (5) hours in a workday, and a second 30-minute unpaid meal period is required for employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday. In addition to meal breaks, California employees are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest period for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. However, compliance with these California meal and rest break regulations is contingent upon several factors, including but not limited to the employee's hours worked daily, shift duration, and job classification. If a California-based non-exempt employee is not provided with a legally compliant meal or rest break as required by California law and detailed in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of this policy, they may be entitled to one hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that the violation occurred.\n\n*   **Waivers:** In some circumstances, eligible employees may waive their meal periods if specific conditions are met, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 512. Please refer to Section 3.2.3 for details on meal period waivers.\n\n*   **Recordkeeping:** Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal and rest breaks in the company's timekeeping system, in accordance with Section 5.1 of this policy.\n\n*   **Policy Updates:** This policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice, as required by applicable law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_meal_rest_break_premium_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"one hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a California-based non-exempt employee is not provided with a legally compliant meal or rest break as required by California law and detailed in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of this policy, they may be entitled to one hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that the violation occurred.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

This policy is designed to comply with both federal and applicable state laws, including those of California where some of our employees are located. Where state law requirements are more stringent, Acme Corp. will comply with the stricter requirements.\n\nFor employees working in California, the following rules apply: If you are a non-exempt employee and your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This meal break should ideally occur before the end of your fifth (5th) hour of work. If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Remember, it is your responsibility to take these breaks.\n\nFurthermore, for every four (4) hours you work, you are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break. Rest breaks are considered time worked and must be taken as near to the midpoint of the four-hour period as is reasonably possible. If operational needs prevent you from taking your meal or rest break, you must immediately notify your supervisor. Failure to do so may impact any claim you might have later. Employees covered by a qualifying collective bargaining agreement may have different rules for meal and rest periods; refer to the applicable CBA for details.\n\nFor employees working outside of California, applicable federal labor laws govern. These laws do not mandate meal or rest breaks. However, Acme Corp. provides employees who work shifts longer than five (5) hours with a voluntary thirty (30) minute unpaid break, though this is not required. Any breaks less than 20 minutes are considered time worked and must be paid.\n\nPlease see Section 5.1 (Attendance and Timekeeping) for procedures on recording meal and rest breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"california_meal_break_eligibility\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"30-minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees working in California, the following rules apply: If you are a non-exempt employee and your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"california_second_meal_break\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Second 30-minute unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"california_rest_break_eligibility\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Paid 10-minute rest break for every 4 hours worked\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"rest\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Furthermore, for every four (4) hours you work, you are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"non_california_voluntary_meal_break\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Voluntary 30-minute unpaid break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees working outside of California, applicable federal labor laws govern.

However, If those employees are classified as \"exempt\" under California labor laws and not covered by collective bargaining agreements, the notice obligation may be waived subject to a legal review by the HR Department, depending on the specific circumstances. Please note that the HR department has final say on whether or not any waivers or other exemptions are applicable. This policy should be read in conjunction with Section 2.05 (Employee Classifications) and Section 8.01 (Termination Procedures).\n\nAny questions regarding this policy should be directed to the HR Department.

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL), ensuring compliance with both federal and state regulations. Employees are encouraged to review this policy in conjunction with Section 3.05, \"Leaves of Absence,\" for a comprehensive understanding of all leave options.\n\n**3.12.1 Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). These reasons include:\n\n*   The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth.\n*   The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement.\n*   To care for the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition.\n*   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job.\n*   Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty.\n\nTo be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Acme Corp for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave. Furthermore, this policy applies to employees where Acme Corp has 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite.\n\n**3.12.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nCalifornia employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of wages, as determined by the State) for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner) or to bond with a new child. Benefits are provided by the State of California, not directly by Acme Corp.\n\n**3.12.3 Coordination of FMLA and PFL**\n\nIn cases where an employee is eligible for both FMLA and PFL for the same qualifying event (e.g., bonding with a new child), the leaves will run concurrently. This means that the 8 weeks of PFL will be counted towards the 12 weeks of FMLA entitlement. However, if the employee is not contributing to SDI, such as in the case of an *employee.employment_status* which is *terminated*, they are not eligible for CA PFL.\n\n**3.12.4 Employee Responsibilities**\n\nEmployees seeking FMLA or PFL leave are required to provide Acme Corp with timely notice of their need for leave, as outlined in Section 3.05. It is the employee's responsibility to understand the requirements and limitations of both FMLA and PFL, as well as Acme Corp's internal policies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_sdi_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for CA PFL\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if the employee is not contributing to SDI, such as in the case of an *employee.employment_status* which is *terminated*, they are not eligible for CA PFL.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "restriction"}}

Employees should review the Timekeeping policy for appropriate procedure to report hours worked.

This policy outlines the requirements for providing meal and rest breaks to eligible employees. The application of this policy depends on the employee's work location, and in some cases, may be impacted by the employee\u2019s job classification.\n\n**3.4.1 General Policy:**\n\nAll non-exempt employees are entitled to rest and meal breaks in accordance with applicable law. However, the specific requirements for meal and rest breaks vary depending on the employee's location and the duration of their shift. Under federal law, there is no requirement to provide meal or rest breaks, but Sterling Dynamics provides such breaks for employee well-being. Where state law provides more stringent requirements, Sterling Dynamics will comply with those requirements.\n\n**3.4.2 California Employees:**\n\nEmployees working in California are subject to the following rules. Employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. Employees working shifts exceeding ten (10) hours are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. These meal breaks must begin before the end of the fifth hour of work and tenth hour of work, respectively. In addition, for every four (4) hours worked (or major fraction thereof), California employees are entitled to a ten (10)-minute paid rest break. To the extent possible, rest breaks should be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period. In the event that an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, the employee may be eligible for one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a break is missed as required by California Labor Code. Please refer to Policy 3.4.5 (\"Waiver of Meal Breaks\") and consult with your manager for further clarification. Employees covered under a valid collective bargaining agreement may be subject to different rules regarding meal and rest breaks. In situations where the daily hours worked is less than 3.5 hours, the rest breaks may be waived by the employee as outlined in the state labor law.\n\n**3.4.3 Non-California Employees:**\n\nFor employees working outside of California, while federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks, Sterling Dynamics encourages managers to provide reasonable break times to ensure employees can maintain their productivity and wellbeing.

This policy outlines the company's procedures for providing notice to employees and government agencies in the event of a mass layoff, plant closing, or relocation. This policy applies exclusively to employees located in California.\n\nSpecifically, if Acme Corp employs 75 or more employees in California, and a mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees occurs at a single site of employment within a 30-day period, then a 60-day advance written notice will be provided to all affected employees. Similarly, if the layoff qualifies as a plant closure, the same 60-day notice requirement applies. This policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of the California WARN Act. Even if the company meets the employee threshold under California law, but does not meet the federal requirement of 100 or more employees total in the company, we will still provide the 60-day notice, but only to employees who are California residents and who are impacted by the action. It is important to note that this policy does not create any contractual rights for employees and may be modified or terminated at any time, with or without notice.

A \"mass layoff\" under federal law is defined as a reduction in force (not due to a plant closing) which results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees if those 50 employees represent at least 33% of the active workforce at the single site of employment, or 500 employees regardless of percentage. The California WARN Act, however, defines a mass layoff more broadly as the termination of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. Therefore, if Acme Corp. employs 75 or more individuals at a worksite located in California, and a planned layoff affects 50 or more employees at that site within a 30-day period, employees will receive the 60-day advance written notice required by the California WARN Act. If the worksite has 100+ employees, Federal WARN act applies. Notice will be provided regardless of whether the affected employees are exempt or non-exempt.

Note that employees classified as non-exempt, and who work in the state of California, may qualify for PFL if they meet the state's SDI contribution requirements and are otherwise taking leave for a qualifying reason under PFL, even if they do not meet the stricter FMLA requirements. The Human Resources Department will determine eligibility for both FMLA and PFL on a case-by-case basis.

It is the policy of XYZ Corp. to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to affected employees, their representatives (if any), the applicable state dislocated worker unit, and the chief elected official of the local government.\n\n**501.2 Applicability**\n\nThis policy applies to all XYZ Corp. employees within the United States. Notwithstanding any other policy, the provisions of this Policy 501 shall govern any potential workforce reduction event.\n\n**501.3 WARN Act Notice Requirements**\n\nXYZ Corp. shall provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff as defined below. For the purposes of this policy and consistent with the federal WARN Act, a *plant closing* is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A *mass layoff* is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing and which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, and these employees constitute at least 33% of the employer's total active workforce at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees are impacted, irrespective of the percentage of the workforce. In the event XYZ Corp.'s employee count is greater than or equal to 100, and a mass layoff occurs resulting in 50 or more employees experiencing an employment loss at a single site of employment, the company shall provide the required 60-day notice.\n\nXYZ Corp. will make reasonable efforts to provide notice as early as possible when workforce reductions are necessary, even if all technical requirements for WARN Act notice are not met.\n\n**501.4 Exceptions**\n\n[This section will contain exceptions and exemptions to WARN Act requirements in future policy updates.

These requirements do *not* apply to employees based outside of California, or to employees classified as exempt under applicable wage and hour laws.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nAcme Corp. provides meal breaks to ensure the health and well-being of its employees. In compliance with California Labor Code Section 512, if you are a non-exempt employee working in California and your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This meal break must begin before the end of your fifth (5th) hour of work. If your shift is longer than ten (10) hours, you are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This second meal break must begin before the end of your tenth (10th) hour of work. You must be completely relieved of all duties during your meal break. You should not be expected or required to perform any work, whether active or inactive, during this time. Failure to provide the required meal breaks may result in premium pay, as outlined in Section 3.4.3. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal breaks in the timekeeping system. If an employee voluntarily chooses to work through their meal period, the employee must notify their supervisor prior to the start of the shift. If a non-exempt employee is working in California and employee.shift_hours is greater than 5, employee is entitled to a 30 minute unpaid meal break.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nEmployees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, if possible, be taken in the middle of the work period.\n\n**3.4.3 Premium Pay for Missed Breaks**\n\nIn accordance with California law, if an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, Acme Corp. will pay the employee one (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal or rest break is not provided."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a non-exempt employee is working in California and employee.shift_hours is greater than 5, employee is entitled to a 30 minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Employees located outside of California are subject to the break laws of their respective states, if any.\n\nAll non-exempt California employees are entitled to meal and rest breaks as required by California law. It is Acme Corp's intention to comply with all applicable laws related to employee meal and rest breaks. However, the implementation of these breaks is contingent upon the employee's cooperation. If an employee fails to accurately record their break times or prevents themselves from being completely relieved of duty during their meal period, Acme Corp will not be held liable for any missed breaks.\n\nSpecifically, if you work more than five (5) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, which must be taken before the end of your fifth hour of work. If you work more than ten (10) hours in a workday, you are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. Employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.

Starlight Technologies is committed to complying with all applicable state and federal wage and hour laws, but in cases of ambiguity, California law will govern the overtime pay calculation for California-based employees.\n\nOvertime pay is required for all non-exempt employees who work more than eight (8) hours in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek. For these employees, overtime will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, and/or forty (40) in a workweek. In addition, employees working in California are entitled to double their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a single workday. Furthermore, double time pay applies to hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, provided the employee has been actively working at Starlight Technologies for more than 3 months; new hires may be exempted at the discretion of management. This policy aims to ensure compliance with California Labor Code sections 510 and 515, and any discrepancies will be interpreted in accordance with these codes. Employees must receive prior authorization from their supervisor or manager before working any overtime hours; unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action.

Unified Global Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) is committed to conducting workforce reductions, including mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, specifically the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (\"WARN Act,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.). This Section 3.12 outlines the Company\u2019s policy regarding notifications related to workforce reductions.\n\n4.  12.2 WARN Act Notification Requirements. Subject to the exclusions outlined in 3.12.3, in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff as defined by the federal WARN Act, the Company shall provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees. For the purposes of this policy and compliance with the federal WARN Act, a \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force, not resulting from a plant closing, which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if these employees represent at least 33 percent of the employees (excluding employees employed on a part-time basis); or 500 or more employees (regardless of the percentage of the employees at the site).\n\n5.  12.3 Exceptions and Conditions. Notwithstanding Section 3.12.2, the notice requirements may be reduced or eliminated under certain circumstances as explicitly provided in the federal WARN Act. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, unforeseeable business circumstances (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(A)), faltering company (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(1)), and natural disaster (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(B)). The Company will determine the applicability of these exceptions on a case-by-case basis and will document its reasoning. Furthermore, if the affected employee count is not_in the range of 50 to 499 employees, the Company will evaluate the percentage impact on the employee base, and provide 60 days notification if the number of employees affected represents at least 33 percent of the employees at the site.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks (California Employees)**\n**Revision Date: 2024-10-27**\n**Effective Date: 2024-11-01**\n\nThis section outlines Acme Corp.'s policy regarding meal and rest breaks for employees working in California, in compliance with applicable California labor laws. While Acme Corp. strives to provide consistent policies across all locations, California's specific regulations require unique provisions as outlined below. Please note this policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice, at the sole discretion of Acme Corp. Human Resources. Employees are responsible for staying informed of any updates to this policy, which will be available on the company intranet.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks:**\n\nNon-exempt employees working in California are generally entitled to a meal period of not less than 30 minutes for each work period of more than five (5) hours. This meal period must begin before the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second meal period of not less than 30 minutes is generally required, unless an exception applies and is agreed to in writing by both the employee and the employer, as permitted by applicable California law and documented in the employee's personnel file, subject to the discretion of management and business necessity. Specifically, the first meal period may be waived by mutual written agreement of the employer and employee only if the total hours worked is no more than six hours. While Acme Corp. aims to comply with California law, employees acknowledge that occasionally operational needs may impact the ability to consistently provide uninterrupted meal breaks.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the employee has worked for longer than 5 hours and their daily hours exceed 6 hours, but management deems it vital that the employee complete a critical work task before commencing their break, no claim for meal break penalties arises and the employee is considered compliant if their manager authorizes a late break.

It is important to note that this policy only covers requirements imposed by the federal WARN Act.\n\n**(a) WARN Act Notice Requirements**\n\nIn the event of a plant closing or mass layoff, Sterling Dynamics will provide advance written notice to affected employees, their representatives (if any), and relevant government entities as required by the federal WARN Act. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and if these 50 or more employees make up at least 33% of the workforce OR 500 or more employees, again excluding any part-time employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, if Sterling Dynamics employs fewer than 100 employees company-wide, as determined by payroll records and IRS filings, and a reduction in force affects fewer than 50 employees during any 30-day period, then the WARN Act notice requirements shall not apply. Should any situation potentially triggering the WARN Act arise, the Legal Department and Human Resources must be consulted immediately to determine the appropriate course of action.

Timely payment of wages is a legal requirement and a commitment we take seriously. This policy applies to all employees of Acme Corp., regardless of location, however, certain provisions apply specifically to employees working in California.\n\n**General Policy:** Federal law (specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act) requires that terminated employees receive their final paycheck no later than the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination date. This applies to employees in all states except where state law mandates a faster payment timeline.\n\n**California Employees:** In California, Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 specify different requirements. If an employee is involuntarily terminated (laid off or fired), their final paycheck, including all earned wages, must be provided to them *immediately* upon termination. If an employee *voluntarily* resigns *and* provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, their final paycheck must be ready and available to them on their last day of employment. If an employee resigns *without* providing at least 72 hours' advance notice, the final paycheck is due within 72 hours of their last day of employment. In such cases, the final paycheck will be mailed to the employee's address on record unless other arrangements have been made. For California employees, the more stringent California rules take precedence over the general federal rule. See also Section 2.8 regarding record retention requirements.\n\n**Out-of-State Employees:** Employees outside of California will receive their final paycheck on the next regularly scheduled payday, as per federal law.\n\n**Contents of Final Paycheck:** The final paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including regular wages, overtime pay, accrued and unused vacation time (if applicable), and any other compensation owed to the employee.

For purposes of this policy section, the California WARN Act will be the governing law if fewer than 100 employees are impacted by the layoff or plant closure, which might trigger federal guidelines if the numbers were higher.\n\nA \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that results in the termination of 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. However, for California employees, this applies if TechForward Inc. employs, or has employed within the preceding 36 months, 75 or more persons, and is not just those terminated; the employee threshold for federal WARN is 100. A \"plant closure\" is defined as the shutdown of a worksite that results in the termination of employment for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. Relocation has specific, detailed stipulations per the CA WARN ACT.\n\nWhile we will strive to provide as much advance notice as possible, unforeseen business circumstances, as reasonably defined under the WARN Act, may necessitate shorter notice periods.

This policy applies to all Acme Corp. employees working in the State of California. In the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, as defined below, Acme Corp. will provide advance written notice to affected employees and relevant government agencies in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (both federal and California versions, specifically Cal.

A \u201cmass layoff\u201d is defined as a reduction in force resulting in employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees.\n\nHowever, if the layoff is the result of unforeseen business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that the notice would have been required, a shorter notice period may be provided, as permitted by law. In such instances, Acme Corp. will provide as much notice as is practicable and will include a statement explaining the reason for the reduced notice period. This exception will be evaluated in compliance with Section 3.15 (Exceptions to Policies). The determination of whether 'unforeseen business circumstances' applies in a given situation will be made by the VP of Human Resources and General Counsel, and their determination is final. Note that this 75-employee threshold for California employees, and a 60-day notice period, also applies even in scenarios that do not meet the formal legal definition of a \"mass layoff\" if, in the determination of the company, a sufficiently large number of employees are affected such that similar notice would be beneficial and compliant with the spirit of the regulations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"employees affected by mass layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_period_days\": 60\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For California employees, if Acme Corp. employs 75 or more individuals, either company-wide or within a 75-mile radius of the affected worksite, and a mass layoff occurs affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day advance written notice will generally be provided.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Acme Corp.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"notice_type\": \"written\",\n          \"recipient\": \"affected employees and relevant government agencies\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, as defined below, Acme Corp. will provide advance written notice to affected employees and relevant government agencies in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (both federal and California versions, specifically Cal.

Overtime is calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\n**Daily Overtime:** In accordance with California law, any hours worked beyond eight (8) hours in a workday will be paid at the overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate. For example, if an employee works ten (10) hours in a day, the first eight (8) hours will be paid at the regular rate, and the additional two (2) hours will be paid at the 1.5x overtime rate.\n\n**Double Time:** California law also requires double-time pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) in a single workday. Therefore, any non-exempt employee who works longer than 12 hours in a workday will receive double their regular rate for all time worked over 12 hours. The policy regarding consecutive workdays is described in section 3.2.5.\n\n**Workweek Definition:** For purposes of calculating overtime, Sterling Innovations defines the workweek as beginning at 12:00 AM on Sunday and ending at 11:59 PM on the following Saturday.

A \"mass layoff\" under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101, et seq., is defined as a reduction in force (excluding terminations for cause, voluntary departures, or retirements) that results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees regardless of percentage. Under California's WARN Act, Cal. Labor Code sections 1400 et seq., a mass layoff is defined as the termination of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.\n\n**3.12.2 Notice Period:**\n\nIf Acme Co. employs 100 or more employees (nationwide), and a mass layoff or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees is planned, the company must provide at least 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees, their representatives (if any), the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the chief elected official of the local government. If the company employs 75 or more employees in California, and a mass layoff or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees occurs in California, the company must comply with California WARN regulations, providing 60 days' notice as described above.

It is important to note that while we adhere to federal law under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), California law provides additional protections. This policy applies only to employees whose primary work location is within California and supersedes any conflicting company policy, practice, or agreement. The intent of this policy is to ensure that The Innovative Solutions Group, Inc. complies with all applicable wage and hour laws.\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay under the following conditions: Overtime compensation will be calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday or forty (40) hours in a workweek. However, this does not include employees who are employed through temporary staffing services contracted by The Innovative Solutions Group, Inc., whose overtime is covered under their respective contracts, nor employees under specific collective bargaining agreements providing comparable overtime benefits. Further, and to avoid any doubt, hours worked must be formally approved by the employee's supervisor or department head to qualify for overtime compensation. Any hours not pre-approved will not be considered for overtime until such approval is granted, although employees will still be compensated at their regular hourly rate for those hours. In situations where an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a workday or more than eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek, compensation will be calculated at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding twelve (12) or eight (8) respectively on the seventh consecutive day.

This policy section applies only to employees working in California.\n\nThe California WARN Act (Cal. Labor Code sections 1400 et seq.) mandates that employers with 75 or more employees (including both full-time and part-time employees) provide 60 days' advance written notice to affected employees before any mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closure or relocation, and that results in employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. A \"plant closure\" occurs when an employer shuts down a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, and the shutdown results in an employment loss during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. A \"relocation\" means that an employer moves all or substantially all of the operations of the employer from one location to a different location 100 miles or more away.\n\nTherefore, if Innovation Solutions Inc. employs 75 or more individuals in California and a planned mass layoff will affect 50 or more employees within a 30-day period, the company is required to provide affected employees with a written notice at least 60 days in advance of the date of the layoff. This notification must be given to the employees\u2019 bargaining representatives, if any, the affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local workforce investment board.

To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must (a) have been employed by Sterling Dynamics, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months; (b) have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave; and (c) be employed at a worksite where Sterling Dynamics, Inc. employs fifty (50) or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\n\n5.03.2 Qualifying Reasons for FMLA Leave\n\nQualifying reasons for FMLA leave include: (a) the birth of a child and to bond with the newborn child within one year of birth; (b) the placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to bond with the newly placed child within one year of placement; (c) to care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; (d) a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job; (e) any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces.\n\n5.03.3 Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave\n\nFMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances, particularly when medically necessary to care for a family member with a serious health condition or due to the employee's own serious health condition, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 5.04 regarding medical certification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an employee whose employment status is \"terminated\" or \"resigned\" as documented according to policy section 2.15 shall not be eligible for FMLA benefits if the leave request occurs after the termination date or resignation date, regardless of whether the event triggering the leave occurred prior to termination/resignation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid, job-protected leave under FMLA\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"leave_duration_weeks\": 12\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must (a) have been employed by Sterling Dynamics, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months; (b) have worked for at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave; and (c) be employed at a worksite where Sterling Dynamics, Inc. employs fifty (50) or more employees within a 75-mile radius.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_termination_ineligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"terminated\",\n            \"resigned\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"medical\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA benefits\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an employee whose employment status is \\\"terminated\\\" or \\\"resigned\\\" as documented according to policy section 2.15 shall not be eligible for FMLA benefits if the leave request occurs after the termination date or resignation date, regardless of whether the event triggering the leave occurred prior to termination/resignation.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "pfl_fmla", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

Acme Corp is committed to complying with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\n**3.2.1 Overtime Eligibility**\n\nEmployees classified as non-exempt are eligible for overtime pay. As defined in Section 2.1 (Employee Classifications), non-exempt employees are those who are subject to federal wage and hour laws. To reiterate, only *non-exempt* employees may earn overtime. Exempt employees receive a fixed salary regardless of hours worked and are not eligible for overtime compensation. If there are any questions regarding your classification, please see your manager or refer to HR.\n\n**3.2.2 Overtime Calculation**\n\nOvertime pay is calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay. This applies when a non-exempt employee works more than 40 hours in a single workweek. For example, if an employee's regular hourly rate is $20.00 per hour, their overtime rate will be $30.00 per hour. The workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM through Saturday at 11:59 PM. Hours worked beyond 40 hours within this timeframe are subject to overtime compensation. Time off such as vacation days, sick leave, or unpaid leave are *not* included when calculating total hours worked in a workweek for the purpose of overtime. Overtime pay will be included in the employee's regular paycheck for the pay period in which the overtime hours were worked.

In the event of a workforce reduction impacting a significant number of employees, the company will adhere to the requirements of both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the California WARN Act (collectively, \"WARN Acts\"), where applicable.\n\nThe circumstances under which TechForward will provide notice under the WARN Acts are as follows:\n\n*   **Federal WARN Act:** In accordance with the federal WARN Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101, et seq., TechForward will provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff affecting at least 50 employees (excluding part-time employees, as defined by the federal WARN Act) at a single site of employment, provided that the number of affected employees constitutes at least 33% of the total number of employees at that site. If the employee count is less than 100, this provision is void.\n\n*   **California WARN Act:** TechForward will also comply with the California WARN Act, Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 1400 et seq., which requires 60 calendar days advance written notice of a mass layoff, relocation, or termination (as defined in the statute) affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period at a single site of employment. This California requirement applies if TechForward employs 75 or more persons within California. However, if TechForward is actively seeking capital to prevent or postpone a shutdown, and believes in good faith that giving notice would preclude it from obtaining the capital, then a shorter notice period may be provided, subject to statutory penalties and requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific requirements of the WARN Acts are complex and subject to change. TechForward's Human Resources Department will be responsible for determining the applicability of the WARN Acts to any particular workforce reduction event and will ensure compliance with all applicable requirements. The applicability of either act will be determined by a review of the total employee count both company-wide and at the affected location.

This policy applies solely to employees whose primary work location is within California. For employees working outside of California, please refer to Section 3.5, \"Meal and Rest Breaks (Non-California Employees)\".\n\nAcme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable California labor laws. Non-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break. This meal break should ideally commence no later than the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. Employees working shifts exceeding ten (10) hours are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, which should ideally begin no later than the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work. However, this second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee only if the total hours worked are no more than twelve (12) hours AND the first meal period was not waived.\n\nIn addition to meal breaks, non-exempt California employees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. To the extent possible, rest breaks will be scheduled in the middle of each four-hour work period.\n\nIt is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all meal and rest breaks taken. Any failure to provide the required meal or rest periods will result in one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that the break is not provided, as per California law.

We strive to comply with both California Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n**California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** If you are a California employee who contributes to State Disability Insurance (SDI), you may be eligible for up to 8 weeks of partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of your usual wages) through California\u2019s PFL program. This leave can be used to bond with a new child (within one year of birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). Eligibility for PFL benefits is determined by the State of California, not by Sterling Innovations.\n\n**Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave per 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Sterling Innovations for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive), have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave, and work at a location where Sterling Innovations employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. FMLA leave can be taken for the birth and care of a newborn child; placement of a child for adoption or foster care; to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or for your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job.\n\n**Coordination of PFL and FMLA:** If you are eligible for both PFL and FMLA for the same event (e.g., bonding with a new child), the leaves will run concurrently. This means the 8 weeks of PFL will count towards your 12 weeks of FMLA leave. However, if you are terminated while on family leave and you have already used 12 weeks of leave, you are not eligible to return to your position. If you were terminated involuntarily, the company will notify you of your ineligibility for reinstatement.\n\n**Employee Responsibilities:** Employees planning to take family or medical leave must provide Sterling Innovations with as much advance notice as possible. Failure to provide adequate notice may delay or deny your leave request.

Acme Corp. provides both California Paid Family Leave (PFL) and Federal Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) benefits to eligible employees, subject to the provisions outlined below. PFL benefits are governed by California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 3300 et seq., and FMLA leave is governed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq.\n\n5.3.2 **California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**. Employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) shall be eligible for California Paid Family Leave benefits pursuant to California law. Specifically, employees with an active employment_status at Acme Corp, whose employee.location_state is California, and who pay into SDI (employee.sdi_contributor = true) are eligible. Paid Family Leave provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of wages) for up to eight (8) weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law. The maximum duration of PFL leave, in combination with other leaves, will be subject to review and may result in termination.\n\n5.3.3 **Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**. Eligible employees are entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, or to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition.

This policy outlines the procedures for issuing final paychecks to employees whose employment with Veridian Dynamics has ended. The timing of the final paycheck depends on the reason for separation (termination, resignation, or layoff), the employee's location, and, in some cases, the amount of notice provided.\n\nFor employees located in California, California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 govern the timing of final paychecks in many situations. Specifically, if an employee is involuntarily terminated, all wages due are payable *immediately* at the time of termination. If an employee resigns, the timing of the final paycheck depends on the amount of notice given. If an employee provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of resignation, the final paycheck will be available on the employee's last day of employment.

In compliance with both federal and California law, the company adheres to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. This policy outlines Acme Corp.\u2019s obligations concerning advance notice of mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations.\n\nThe general rule is that Acme Corp. *may* be required to provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice of a qualifying plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation, as defined under the applicable federal or state WARN Act (whichever is more generous to employees). What constitutes a \"qualifying\" event depends on several factors, including the number of employees affected and the location of the affected employees.\n\nSpecifically, if Acme Corp. anticipates a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that will affect 50 or more employees at a single site of employment *and* the employer employs 100 or more employees *or* if Acme Corp. anticipates such an event affecting 50 or more employees *and* the affected employees work in California, the sixty (60) day notice requirement is triggered. However, even if the total number of affected employees *across all sites* is over 50, but no single site meets the minimum threshold, this policy does not apply, and those employee reductions should be processed according to Policy 3.3 (Performance Improvement and Termination). Also, it is worth noting that the employee count threshold for California employees is seventy-five (75) employees, as stipulated by the California WARN Act, Labor Code Sections 1400 et seq. Exceptions to the notice requirement may apply in certain unforeseeable business circumstances, natural disasters, or if the company is actively seeking capital and believes that providing notice would jeopardize its ability to obtain the necessary capital.\n\nConsult with the Legal Department for further guidance, and review Section 1.2 for definitions of key terms such as \"mass layoff,\" \"plant closure,\" and \"relocation.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of a qualifying plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, if Acme Corp. anticipates a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that will affect 50 or more employees at a single site of employment *and* the employer employs 100 or more employees *or* if Acme Corp. anticipates such an event affecting 50 or more employees *and* the affected employees work in California, the sixty (60) day notice requirement is triggered.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This policy outlines the company's guidelines regarding meal and rest breaks, in compliance with applicable federal law.\n\nAll non-exempt employees are eligible for breaks during their workday, subject to operational needs and supervisory approval. While Sterling Dynamics is not mandated to provide meal or rest breaks under federal law, it does so to promote employee well-being. Specifically, employees who work a minimum of six (6) hours in a single workday are eligible for a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, provided that the employee is completely relieved of all duties during this time. This meal break should ideally be taken near the midpoint of the shift, but departmental managers retain discretion over scheduling to ensure adequate coverage of business operations.\n\nFurthermore, short breaks, not exceeding twenty (20) minutes, may be provided during the workday. These breaks will be considered time worked and will be paid. It is important to note that the granting of these short breaks is subject to continued satisfactory performance and adherence to company policies, as outlined in Section 5.2 (\"Performance Management\") and 6.1 (\"Conduct and Ethics\"). Sterling Dynamics reserves the right to modify or discontinue this practice at any time with or without notice. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal break times.

This policy outlines the circumstances under which overtime pay will be provided to eligible employees.\n\nNon-exempt employees, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), are eligible for overtime pay. Overtime pay will be calculated at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. This policy applies to all employees regardless of location or whether the company operates with more than 50 employees at a single worksite or combined locations. However, the decision to allow any employee to work overtime is solely at the discretion of the employee's supervisor and must be pre-approved in writing. Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any hours worked beyond the standard 40 hours must be accurately recorded on the employee's timesheet and submitted for approval. Failure to accurately report hours worked can lead to miscalculation of pay and therefore can also lead to discipline, up to and including termination. If an employee incorrectly records his/her time, it's the employee's responsiblity to notify their supervisor immediately, no matter the result of the miscalculation. Any falsification of time records will be subject to severe disciplinary actions including immediate termination.\n\nEmployees are expected to manage their work schedules effectively to avoid incurring unauthorized overtime.\n\nNote: This policy applies to all US employees and does not incorporate any state-specific overtime requirements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"unauthorized_overtime_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"pre-approval for overtime\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"inaccurate_time_reporting_termination_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"accurate reporting of worked hours\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Failure to accurately report hours worked can lead to miscalculation of pay and therefore can also lead to discipline, up to and including termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"falsification_termination_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"accurate reporting of worked hours\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Any falsification of time records will be subject to severe disciplinary actions including immediate termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"schedule_management_termination_004\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"effective work schedule management\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees are expected to manage their work schedules effectively to avoid incurring unauthorized overtime.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Please also refer to Section 2.1 (Definitions) for clarity on terms like \"termination\" and \"regular payday.\"\n\n**3.2.1 Timing of Final Paycheck**\n\nUpon termination of employment, the timing of the final paycheck disbursement depends on the circumstances of the termination and the employee's location of work. For employees whose primary work location is in California, if the termination is involuntary, all wages earned and unpaid are due and payable immediately at the time of termination. Note, however, that this provision applies only to non-exempt employees; exempt employees in California may be subject to a 72-hour window to receive their final pay if the separation is initiated by Acme Corp. If an employee voluntarily resigns, and provides at least 72 hours\u2019 notice of their intention to resign, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. However, if an employee provides less than 72 hours\u2019 notice of resignation, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of their last day. All other employees outside of California shall receive their final paycheck no later than the next regularly scheduled payday following their termination. Acme Corp reserves the right to mail the final paycheck to the employee's last known address, if direct deposit is not already established or if the employee does not collect the check in person after reasonable notice. In cases where employees are terminated for cause, additional review may be required, potentially extending the final paycheck disbursement timeline up to the next regular payday."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_ca_involuntary\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"final paycheck disbursement immediately\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees whose primary work location is in California, if the termination is involuntary, all wages earned and unpaid are due and payable immediately at the time of termination.

(the Fair Labor Standards Act), the Company provides unpaid meal periods to employees who are completely relieved of all duties during the period. Such meal periods, when provided, shall be at least thirty (30) minutes in duration.

In such cases, the Company is not obligated to provide said breaks prior to the termination date.\n\n3.4.3. With respect to rest periods, the Company may, but is not required to, provide paid rest periods of short duration, typically not exceeding twenty (20) minutes. Any such rest periods, if offered, must be counted as hours worked. However, failure to utilize an offered rest period shall not constitute grounds for termination of employment, provided that the employee remains productive and complies with all other Company policies and procedures. Rest periods shall only be provided to employees who have requested a rest period and the request is approved by a supervisor.\n\n3.4.4. Notwithstanding Section 3.4.2 and 3.4.3, the Company reserves the right to modify or eliminate meal or rest periods based on business necessity and in accordance with applicable federal law.

This Section 3.4 applies *only* to non-exempt employees working physically within the State of California. For employees *not* physically working in California, federal overtime rules apply (see Section 3.5). Non-exempt California employees will generally be eligible for overtime pay, which is paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight (8) in a workday, or over forty (40) in a workweek. Please note, however, that if an employee works more than twelve (12) hours in a workday, they will be paid double (2x) their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over twelve (12) hours in that workday.\n\nFurthermore, if a non-exempt California employee works for more than eight (8) hours on their seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek, they will be compensated at double their regular rate of pay for those hours. However, this seventh-day double-time provision will *only* be triggered if the employee's normal work schedule is five (5) days or more per week. If the employee *voluntarily* works a schedule of four (4) days or fewer per week and then agrees to work a seventh day, they will *not* be entitled to double-time pay unless they work more than 40 hours that week or more than 12 hours on that seventh day. It is *also* important to note that any hours previously compensated at the double-time rate (due to the \"more than 12 hours\" provision) *will not* count towards the trigger of the 7th consecutive day overtime rule. The policy outlined in this section supersedes any conflicting information provided verbally. All overtime *must* be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s manager. Failure to obtain approval *may* lead to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.

General Provisions**\n\nThis Family and Medical Leave Policy (the \"Policy\") governs the availability of leave to eligible employees of Veritas Industries (\"the Company\") pursuant to both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq., and the California Paid Family Leave Act (\"PFL\"), California Unemployment Insurance Code \u00a7 3300 et seq. It is the Company\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable federal and state laws regarding family and medical leave. In the event of any conflict between this Policy and applicable law, applicable law shall govern.\n\n**4.3.2. Eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits**\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.3.1, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section, employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, and who contribute to the California State Disability Insurance (\"SDI\") program, may be eligible for California PFL benefits. Benefits may be available for leave taken to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member, as defined under California law. Payment under PFL shall be determined pursuant to the statutory formula established by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). The maximum duration of PFL benefits shall be governed by California law, current at the time the leave is taken. However, an employee shall not be eligible for California PFL if they have already been granted 12 weeks of leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) *and* are non-exempt.\n\n**4.3.3. Concurrent Leave**\n\nVeritas Industries adheres to a concurrent leave policy. Where an employee's leave qualifies under both the FMLA and PFL, the Company shall designate the leave as running concurrently under both federal and state law, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\n**4.3.4. Employee Notice Requirements**\n\nEmployees are required to provide the Company with at least 30 days advance notice of the need for foreseeable family or medical leave, in accordance with applicable FMLA and PFL regulations. If 30 days advance notice is not practicable, notice must be given as soon as practicable. Failure to provide adequate notice may result in delay or denial of leave.\n\n**4.3.5.

Please note that this policy only applies to California-based employees. Employees working outside of California should refer to Section 5.8 for the leave policy applicable to their location.\n\n**5.7.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nIf you are a California employee and pay into State Disability Insurance (SDI), you are likely eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement, typically 60-70% of your usual wages, for up to 8 weeks. This leave can be used to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling). See the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD) website for further eligibility details.\n\n**5.7.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for SparkleTech for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive), and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months prior to the start of your leave. Also, SparkleTech must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite. This leave can be used for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child; to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, or parent); or for your own serious health condition. If you meet the eligibility requirements for both PFL and FMLA for the same qualifying event (like parental bonding), these leaves will typically run concurrently. This means that the first 8 weeks would be paid under PFL (subject to eligibility), and the remaining 4 weeks would be unpaid under FMLA, up to the total of 12 weeks permitted.\n\n**5.7.3 Combining PFL and FMLA:**\n\nWhere an employee working in California is eligible for BOTH PFL and FMLA leave for the same reason, the PFL leave will run concurrently with the FMLA leave, up to the maximum allowed under FMLA (12 weeks). This means that if you are approved for 8 weeks of PFL for newborn bonding, those 8 weeks will also be counted toward your 12-week FMLA entitlement. You are not entitled to 20 weeks of leave (8 weeks PFL + 12 weeks FMLA) for the same qualifying event."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you are a California employee and pay into State Disability Insurance (SDI), you are likely eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for SparkleTech for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive), and have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months prior to the start of your leave.

This section outlines our policies regarding Paid Family Leave (PFL) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It's crucial to understand that while we strive to provide comprehensive benefits, the specific eligibility and duration of leave may vary based on your individual circumstances and applicable state and federal laws. This policy is intended to comply with both California law and federal law where applicable.\n\nSpecifically, for employees working in California, if you contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) and have a qualifying need, such as bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member as defined under California law, you may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement, typically between 60-70% of your usual wages, for up to eight (8) weeks. However, simultaneous leave under both PFL and FMLA is possible, but any time taken concurrently shall be deducted from your total available leave.\n\nMoreover, to be considered eligible, you should have active status as an employee. If, for any reason, your employment status is anything other than active, such as when an employee is terminated or has officially resigned, they may not be eligible for leave benefits, even if they have previously met the other conditions for PFL or FMLA. Please consult with HR to determine the full interplay between the two types of leave and how your absences will be recorded.\n\nXYZ Corp. also adheres to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). FMLA generally provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. Eligibility requirements under FMLA include working for XYZ Corp. for at least 12 months and having worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months prior to the leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, for employees working in California, if you contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) and have a qualifying need, such as bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member as defined under California law, you may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"XYZ Corp.

This policy outlines Sterling Dynamics, Inc.'s commitment to complying with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, both federal and California-specific, in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. The requirements outlined below apply only to employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. This section is intended to comply with both the federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.) and the California WARN Act (California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1408).\n\n3.12.2 Applicability. Sterling Dynamics, Inc. shall provide at least sixty (60) calendar days' advance written notice of any plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation, as defined below, impacting its California workforce. Notwithstanding the above, for the purposes of this Section, a mass layoff is defined as a reduction in force resulting in job losses at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees; provided, however, that this applies only if Sterling Dynamics, Inc. employs 75 or more employees at the applicable work site, or employs 75 or more employees in California. For the purposes of determining whether the 75-employee threshold is met, employees who are considered \"part-time\" as defined under the federal WARN Act will be included in the count. If the employment losses occur over a period exceeding 30 days but not exceeding 90 days, and the number of employees affected meets the aforementioned criteria for a 30-day period, all employment losses within that 90-day period will be aggregated.

To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Stellar Dynamics, Inc. for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave, provided that Stellar Dynamics, Inc. employs fifty (50) or more employees within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of the employee's worksite. For California-based employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI), Paid Family Leave (PFL) may be available for up to eight (8) weeks to bond with a new child, or to care for a seriously ill family member. Eligibility for PFL is determined by the California Employment Development Department (EDD).\n\n3.05.2. **Concurrent Leave:** Stellar Dynamics, Inc. requires that any leave taken which qualifies for both FMLA and PFL run concurrently. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total combined leave duration shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks in a twelve-month period, calculated from the date of first leave.\n\n3.05.3. **Compensation during Leave:** Leave taken under FMLA is unpaid, unless otherwise provided by applicable law or company policy. For California-based employees eligible for and approved for PFL benefits by the EDD, compensation will be determined according to EDD guidelines, currently sixty to seventy percent (60-70%) of the employee\u2019s normal wages, subject to statutory limitations and deductions. Employees must apply for PFL benefits directly with the EDD.\n\n3.05.4. **Return to Work:** Upon return from FMLA or PFL leave, employees are generally entitled to be restored to their original or

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.4: Overtime Compensation (California Employees Only)**\n**Effective Date: 2024-07-01**\n**Revision: 1.0**\n\nAcme Corp. values its employees and is committed to complying with all applicable wage and hour laws. This Section 3.4 applies *only* to employees physically working within the State of California.\n\nFor non-exempt employees in California, overtime compensation will be paid in accordance with California law. Specifically, if a non-exempt employee works more than eight (8) hours in a workday, or more than forty (40) hours in a workweek, they are generally entitled to overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for those excess hours.\n\nFurthermore, California law also mandates double-time pay (2.0 times the regular rate) for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) in any workday. Employees who work seven consecutive days in a workweek are also entitled to double-time pay for any hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh day. It is Acme Corp.'s policy to attempt to avoid situations necessitating seven consecutive workdays, unless project deadlines or specific client needs make it absolutely unavoidable, in which case management approval is required before any employee may work seven consecutive days.\n\nThis policy should not be interpreted to allow \u201cpyramiding\u201d of overtime. Overtime hours are calculated based on the highest applicable rate, not cumulative rates.

Evergreen Solutions, Inc. is committed to providing a safe and productive work environment while adhering to all applicable labor laws.\n\n3.4.2. **Meal Breaks:** Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 512, all non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours in California shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, duty-free meal break. For non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding ten (10) hours in California, a second thirty (30) minute uninterrupted, duty-free meal break shall be provided. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties during meal periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for employees in states other than California, Evergreen Solutions, Inc. shall provide meal breaks in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Where federal law governs, employees will be considered to have waived the right to a meal break if they voluntarily choose to work through the meal period. Employees whose shift is six hours or less may waive the meal period by mutual consent with Evergreen Solutions, Inc.. A written waiver is required and must be kept on file for each employee. Failure to provide meal breaks as required under California law will result in one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that the meal break is not provided.\n\n3.4.3. **Rest Breaks:** Consistent with California Labor Code Section 226.7, non-exempt employees working in California are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks shall, to the extent practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. If an employee works more than two hours, they must be provided with a rest period. Employees in states other than California are not entitled to mandatory rest breaks under federal law.

For the purposes of this policy, a \"plant closing\" refers to the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment. This percentage calculation excludes any part-time employees, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nThe 60-day notice requirement applies to any Acme Corp. site if the employer employee count is greater than 100 AND if a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees occurs. The notice must be provided to affected employees, any representative employee unions, and the appropriate state and local government entities. The notice will contain specific information as required by the WARN Act, including the date of the intended action and a statement of whether the action is expected to be permanent or temporary. Acme Corp. reserves the right to provide more than 60 days notice; however, providing less than 60 days notice could incur significant penalties under the WARN Act.

Furthermore, the Company must employ fifty (50) or more employees within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of the employee's worksite. Failure to meet these eligibility requirements will result in a denial of FMLA leave. An employee who is not an SDI contributor, regardless of meeting the FMLA requirements, shall not be eligible for any PFL benefits as described in Section 3.05.4.\n\n3.05.3. **Duration of FMLA Leave.** Eligible employees may take up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected FMLA leave in a twelve-month period for qualifying reasons, including the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition, or for the employee's own serious health condition.\n\n3.05.4. **California Paid Family Leave (PFL).** In California, eligible employees who are SDI contributors may receive partial wage replacement benefits while taking leave to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member, as defined by California law. The maximum duration for PFL benefits is eight (8) weeks within a twelve (12) month period, and the wage replacement rate is approximately 60-70% of the employee's average weekly wages, subject to state-mandated limits. If an employee voluntarily terminates their employment while receiving California PFL benefits, any remaining PFL benefits shall immediately cease.\n\n3.05.5. **Coordination of FMLA and PFL.** Leave taken under PFL will run concurrently with leave taken under FMLA, to the extent permitted by law."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by the Company for at least twelve (12) months, and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave.

Understanding the interplay between the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL) is crucial for eligible employees.\n\n**3.4.1 Eligibility for Leave**\n\nTo be eligible for leave under this policy, employees must meet the following requirements. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), employees are eligible if they have been employed by OptiCorp for at least 12 months (employee.tenure_months >= 12), have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave (employee.hours_worked_12_months >= 1250), and work at a location where OptiCorp employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius (employer.employee_count_within_75_miles >= 50).\n\nFor employees who work in California, California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides wage replacement benefits, but does *not* guarantee job protection. CA PFL eligibility is tied to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. Therefore, to be eligible for CA PFL benefits, the employee must contribute to SDI (employee.sdi_contributor eq true). Even if an employee qualifies for FMLA and is taking leave for a qualifying reason under California\u2019s PFL, such as bonding with a new child (leave.type eq bonding), the employee will only receive partial wage replacement (60-70% subject to state law) during weeks 1-8 of their leave, while FMLA will protect their job for up to 12 weeks, irrespective of whether the employee resides in California. An employee's eligibility for PFL does not guarantee that leave will be granted for the full FMLA duration of 12 weeks; the length of PFL benefits is defined by CA state law.\n\nPlease refer to Section 3.5, *Short-Term Disability Leave* and Section 3.6, *Long-Term Disability Leave* for information on other leave types.

In accordance with California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512, and related Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) Wage Orders, Acme Corp provides meal and rest breaks as outlined below. This policy does not apply to employees whose employment is covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that expressly provides for meal and rest periods. For questions regarding collective bargaining agreements, please contact the Human Resources Department.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nEmployees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, commencing before the end of the employee\u2019s fifth (5th) hour of work. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break, commencing before the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work. However, if the total hours worked is no more than six (6) hours, the first meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employee and Acme Corp, provided a written waiver is executed by both parties. The second meal period may be waived only if the total hours worked do not exceed twelve (12) hours AND the first meal period was waived. In situations where an employee\u2019s shift is of a shorter duration (less than 5 hours), no meal break is required. The Company retains the right to modify these guidelines as it deems necessary to maintain compliance with state and federal regulations. Exempt employees and employees in roles where it is practically impossible to provide meal breaks may be subject to alternative arrangements, as deemed appropriate by management and in accordance with applicable laws. If an employee in California works less than 6 hours and wishes to voluntarily waive their meal break, they may do so following form HR-342, unless they are employed in a role not classified as customer-facing.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nEmployees are entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, to the extent practicable, be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period.\n\n**3.4.3 Failure to Provide Breaks**\n\nIn the event that Acme Corp fails to provide a meal or rest break as required by law, the employee shall be compensated with one (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the break is not provided."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_waiver_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"right to waive first meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, if the total hours worked is no more than six (6) hours, the first meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employee and Acme Corp, provided a written waiver is executed by both parties.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp Human Resources Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "leave"}}

(FMLA), eligible employees of ABC Corporation shall be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12) month period for qualifying reasons, as further delineated herein. This policy applies to all employees of ABC Corporation employed within the United States.\n\nAn employee shall be considered eligible for FMLA leave if they have been employed by ABC Corporation for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as provided in Section 8.3.2 (Calculation of Leave Entitlement), an employee's eligibility for FMLA leave may be subject to further restrictions.

The workweek is defined as Sunday through Saturday. Overtime pay is calculated at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular hourly rate. This overtime compensation is designed to ensure that employees are fairly compensated for the additional time they dedicate to Acme Corp.\n\nSpecifically, if a non-exempt employee works more than 40 hours in a single workweek (Sunday through Saturday), they will be paid overtime at a rate of 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for each hour exceeding 40. For example, if an employee's regular hourly rate is $20 and they work 45 hours in a workweek, they will be paid $30 per hour (1.5 x $20) for the 5 overtime hours, in addition to their regular pay for the first 40 hours.\n\nThis policy applies to all non-exempt employees of Acme Corp. regardless of their location within the United States. Exempt employees, as defined by the FLSA, are not eligible for overtime pay. Please refer to Policy 3.1, \"Employee Classifications,\" for details on determining employee exempt status. Acme Corp. does not authorize or permit any employee to work unauthorized overtime. Any overtime work must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s supervisor or manager. Failure to obtain prior approval may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.

This policy applies to all GlobalCorp employees, though the specific requirements vary based on the employee\u2019s work location. To ensure consistency and clarity, please consult with your supervisor and the HR department with any questions regarding break times, break periods, and when compensation may be owed.\n\n**General Policy:** GlobalCorp strives to comply with all applicable federal and state laws regarding meal and rest breaks. Federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. Where state law requires meal or rest breaks, GlobalCorp will comply with those laws.\n\n**California Employees:** In California, employees are generally entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break if they work more than five (5) hours in a workday. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, they are generally entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. Employees are also entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\n\n**Meal Break Waiver:** California employees can waive their right to a meal break if they work no more than six (6) hours in a workday, by mutual consent of the employee and the employer. Such agreement must be in writing and can be revoked by either party.\n\n**Break Violations:** In the event that an employee\u2019s meal or rest break is not provided as required by California law, and the employee is required to continue to work through their break, GlobalCorp will provide the employee with one (1) hour of premium pay for each day that a meal or rest break is missed. However, termination for failing to comply with this policy may be considered where failure to provide an adequate break is the result of willful neglect on the part of any supervisor in California, if the employee works at least 35 hours weekly, and the supervisor has already received 2 written warnings regarding break scheduling.\n\n**Non-California Employees:** Employees in states other than California should refer to their state\u2019s specific break laws, if any. If no state law exists, GlobalCorp will adhere to federal guidelines, which require paid breaks of less than 20 minutes.\n\nGlobalCorp reserves the right to modify this policy at any time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"terminate_supervisor_break_violations\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 35\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"GlobalCorp may consider termination for failing to comply with this policy where failure to provide an adequate break is the result of willful neglect on the part of any supervisor in California, if the employee works at least 35 hours weekly, and the supervisor has already received 2 written warnings regarding break scheduling.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, termination for failing to comply with this policy may be considered where failure to provide an adequate break is the result of willful neglect on the part of any supervisor in California, if the employee works at least 35 hours weekly, and the supervisor has already received 2 written warnings regarding break scheduling.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"GlobalCorp Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2025-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "termination"}}

Acme Corp. is committed to complying with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Overtime pay is intended to compensate employees for working beyond their regularly scheduled hours. Please note that this policy applies to all Acme Corp. employees in the United States and is governed exclusively by federal law.\n\n**3.2.1 Overtime Eligibility and Rate**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay for all hours worked exceeding 40 in a workweek. The overtime rate is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For the purposes of this policy, the regular rate of pay includes an employee\u2019s base hourly rate, plus any non-discretionary bonuses, commissions, or other incentive pay earned during the workweek, as detailed in Section 3.3 (Compensation and Benefits). If an employee works over 40 hours in a workweek, they will be paid overtime for those additional hours. An employee's classification as exempt or non-exempt is determined by Human Resources, and employees should direct any questions regarding their classification to their manager or HR representative. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked. Falsification of time records may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek must be approved by the employee's manager prior to being worked. Failure to obtain proper approval may also result in disciplinary action.\n\n**3.2.2: Meal and Rest Breaks**\n\nWhile not directly related to overtime calculation, it is important to remember that employees are entitled to meal and rest breaks as mandated by federal law. These breaks are generally unpaid and do not count towards hours worked for the purpose of overtime calculation. For more information about break periods see Section 4.1 of this Handbook.\n\n**3.2.3: Reporting Overtime Hours**\n\nAll overtime hours must be accurately recorded in the company\u2019s timekeeping system.

Non-exempt employees, as defined under the FLSA, shall be eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek. This policy applies to all employees working within the United States, irrespective of the employee's location or any applicable state laws concerning overtime. Specifically, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Acme Corp. only observes the minimum requirements under the FLSA and does not afford any additional overtime compensation, even if applicable local laws mandate otherwise.\n\n3.4.2. **Conditions for Overtime Eligibility.** To qualify for overtime compensation under this policy, an employee must be classified as non-exempt, maintain an active employment status, and must have worked more than forty (40) hours within the workweek. Furthermore, overtime compensation will only be paid for hours that the employee has been explicitly authorized to work by their direct supervisor. Any hours worked without prior authorization may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Overtime calculations shall be based on the actual hours worked, excluding any paid time off such as vacation, sick leave, or holidays. Note, nothing in this policy guarantees any employee a minimum number of work hours, overtime or otherwise, and Acme Corp. retains the discretion to adjust work schedules as needed. For purposes of clarity, Section 3.4.1 shall supersede any conflicting provisions regarding time-off compensation calculations detailed in Section 4.2.\n\n3.4.3. **Tracking and Reporting.** It is the responsibility of each employee to accurately track and report all hours worked each day, including any overtime hours.

As a California employer, StellarTech adheres to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512 regarding meal and rest breaks. Federal law concerning meal and rest breaks does not apply to StellarTech employees in California to the extent it is less protective of employee rights.\n\nGenerally, employees are entitled to a duty-free, unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes when the total work period for the day is more than five (5) hours. A second meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. However, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee if the total hours worked in a workday are no more than twelve (12) hours and the first meal period was not waived. Non-exempt employees must take their meal periods; failure to do so may result in the employee being paid one hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal period is not provided. In situations where the nature of the work prevents relief from all duty during a 30-minute period after five hours of work, the employee may request a written agreement approved by their manager for an on-duty meal period, which shall be counted as time worked and paid accordingly. On-duty meal periods are an exception and should be rarely approved.\n\nIn addition to meal periods, non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid rest period of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest periods should, insofar as practicable, be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period. If an employee\u2019s shift hours are more than six (6) hours, they are typically entitled to two rest periods. If an employee is not provided with a ten-minute rest break for every four hours worked, or major fraction thereof, StellarTech will pay the employee one hour of premium pay.\n\nPlease contact Human Resources with any questions regarding this policy or its application. Employees should also refer to California Labor Code Sections 226.7 and 512 for detailed information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_entitlement_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Generally, employees are entitled to a duty-free, unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes when the total work period for the day is more than five (5) hours.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"second_meal_break_entitlement_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"second unpaid meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"A second meal period of at least thirty (30) minutes is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"rest_break_entitlement_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 0\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"paid rest break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"rest\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In addition to meal periods, non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid rest period of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"StellarTech Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-04-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

Human Resources Policy Manual**\n**Section 3.12: Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance**\n**Revision Date:** 2024-10-26\n**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to complying with all applicable state and federal laws regarding workforce reductions. This policy outlines the procedures for implementing reductions in force (RIFs), layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, with specific attention to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (both federal and California versions). Compliance with the WARN Act is critical, and any deviation from this policy requires explicit written approval from the Legal Department. See also Policy 7.01: Termination Procedures.\n\n**Notification Requirements:**\n\n*   **General Rule:** Acme Corp. will provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined under the WARN Act, to affected employees.\n\n*   **California Specifics:** While the federal WARN Act applies to employers with 100 or more employees, the California WARN Act (Cal-WARN) has a lower threshold. Therefore, if Acme Corp. employs 75 or more individuals in California, Cal-WARN will apply to any mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period. Specifically, if *employer.employee_count* is greater than or equal to 100 and *layoff.affected_employee_count* is greater than or equal to 50, 60 days notice is required. The 60 days notice is also required if *employee.location_state* is equal to \"CA\" and *employer.employee_count* is greater than or equal to 75 and *layoff.affected_employee_count* is greater than or equal to 50.\n\n*   **Exemptions:** While rare, there may be unforeseen business circumstances that warrant an exception to the 60-day notice requirement. Examples include natural disasters or sudden and unexpected business losses. Should such circumstances arise, the Legal Department must be consulted immediately to determine if an exception applies and to ensure that all legally required notifications and justifications are properly documented. No exceptions can be granted for budgetary reasons.\n\n*   **Content of Notice:** The written notice provided to affected employees will include all information required by the federal and California WARN Acts, including but not limited to: the name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoff will occur; the expected date of the first separation; the types of jobs affected; and contact information for company officials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of plant closing or mass layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"if *employer.employee_count* is greater than or equal to 100 and *layoff.affected_employee_count* is greater than or equal to 50, 60 days notice is required.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"The 60 days notice is also required if *employee.location_state* is equal to \\\"CA\\\" and *employer.employee_count* is greater than or equal to 75 and *layoff.affected_employee_count* is greater than or equal to 50.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reduction and WARN Act Compliance\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2025-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "eligibility"}}

This policy outlines the circumstances under which overtime pay will be provided to eligible employees. This policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice. Please refer to Section 1.2 regarding policy updates.\n\n3.4.2. **Eligibility:** Overtime compensation is generally applicable to non-exempt employees. Exempt employees, as defined under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and California Labor Code, are not eligible for overtime pay. See Section 2.1 for employee classification guidelines.\n\n3.4.3. **Overtime Rate and Calculation:** Apex Technologies calculates overtime pay based on both federal and California law, applying the more generous standard. In accordance with federal law, non-exempt employees will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over forty (40) in a workweek. Additionally, for employees whose employee.location_state is California, if the employee works more than 8 hours in a day, the employee will receive 1.5 times their regular rate of pay for those hours exceeding 8 but less than 12 hours within that day. Any work exceeding 12 hours in a single day, or exceeding 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, will be compensated at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\n3.4.4. **Workweek Definition:** Apex Technologies defines the workweek as beginning at 12:00 AM on Sunday and ending at 11:59 PM on Saturday.\n\n3.4.5. **Authorization:** Overtime work must be authorized in advance by the employee's supervisor.

Human Resources Policy Manual**\n**Section 3.14: Final Paycheck Disbursement**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01; Revision: 2.0**\n\n3.14.1 General Policy: Acme Corp. is committed to ensuring compliance with all applicable federal and state wage and hour laws regarding the timely disbursement of final wages to separating employees. This policy governs the timing of final paycheck issuance for all employees, irrespective of employee.classification (exempt or non-exempt) or employee.pay_type (salaried or hourly), but is subject to the specific provisions outlined below. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources and General Counsel.\n\n3.14.2 Involuntary Termination: Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 201, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, if an employee.location_state is 'CA' and employee.employment_status is 'terminated' through involuntary termination, the employee\u2019s final paycheck, encompassing all wages earned and accrued vacation time, shall be made available to the employee immediately upon termination.\n\n3.14.3 Voluntary Resignation: For employees who voluntarily resign from Acme Corp., the timing of the final paycheck will depend on the amount of notice provided. If an employee.location_state is 'CA' and employee.employment_status is 'resigned', and termination.notice_given is 'true' with termination.notice_hours equal to or greater than 72, the final paycheck shall be made available on the employee\u2019s last day of employment.

Except that, if the employee's termination is due to gross misconduct, Innovix Solutions may delay final payment until a reasonable investigation into the alleged misconduct has been completed, but in no event will this exceed 72 hours. Employees subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements are excluded from the provisions of this paragraph, as their final wage obligations are governed by the specific terms of their union contracts.\n*   If an employee resigns and provides at least 72 hours advance notice of their resignation, their final wages are due and payable on their last day of employment.\n*   If an employee resigns without providing at least 72 hours advance notice, their final wages are due and payable within 72 hours of their last day of employment.\n*   For employees outside of California, Innovix Solutions adheres to federal law and applicable state law, which typically requires final wages to be paid by the next regularly scheduled payday. To expedite this process, final paychecks for terminated employees outside of California will be issued no later than five (5) business days following the employee's last day of employment, irrespective of the regularly scheduled payday.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to consult with the Human Resources Department if they have questions regarding their final paycheck.

The employee's manager is responsible for notifying the Payroll Department immediately upon termination to ensure prompt processing. While Sterling Consolidated aims to expedite this process, unforeseen circumstances, such as payroll system maintenance, may cause delays.\n\nIn cases of layoffs involving multiple employees, Sterling Consolidated will make every effort to process final paychecks for all affected employees on the next regularly scheduled payday following the layoff date. Employees subject to a layoff will receive written notification regarding their final pay, benefits continuation (if applicable), and any other relevant information. Please note that these final paychecks are subject to standard deductions. If an employee believes there is an error in their final paycheck, they should contact the HR department within ten (10) business days to initiate a review.

General Policy Statement.** It is the policy of Zenith Dynamics that all non-exempt employees shall be compensated for overtime hours worked pursuant to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. Overtime compensation shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. This policy supersedes any prior practices or agreements regarding overtime compensation.\n\n**3.4.2. Eligibility.** This policy applies to all Zenith Dynamics employees classified as non-exempt, except as may be specifically excluded by the FLSA. Determination of exempt or non-exempt status is made in accordance with applicable federal law, and Zenith Dynamics retains the sole discretion to determine employee classification. Employees whose primary duty is managing the enterprise, or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof, and who customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees therein, and also have the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight, and who are paid at least $684 per week, are classified as exempt and are therefore ineligible for overtime compensation. Moreover, employees with fewer than 6 months tenure and who are working less than 30 hours per week may be considered as part-time employees under the terms of Section 2.1 of the Company Handbook, and are subject to further restrictions regarding eligibility for certain benefits including overtime.\n\n**3.4.3. Calculation of Overtime.** Overtime compensation will be calculated based on the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay. All remuneration paid to the employee, including but not limited to bonuses, commissions, and other incentive payments, will be included in the calculation of the regular rate, as required under the FLSA.

This policy outlines our approach to Paid Family Leave (PFL) and Family and Medical Leave (FMLA).\n\n**3.4.1 Eligibility and Entitlements**\n\nAcme Corp. complies with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL) for eligible employees in California. FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or the employee's own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA, an employee must have been employed by Acme Corp. for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the leave, and Acme Corp. must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite.\n\nCalifornia PFL provides eligible employees who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) with up to eight (8) weeks of partial wage replacement benefits (approximately 60-70% of wages, as determined by the State of California) when taking time off to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). An employee's eligibility for California PFL benefits requires the employee to be a SDI contributor and have a qualifying leave event. An employee may take both FMLA and PFL concurrently if they meet the eligibility requirements for both.

This policy outlines our approach to Paid Family Leave (PFL) under California law and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for employees working in California.\n\n**California Paid Family Leave (PFL):** If you are a California employee who contributes to State Disability Insurance (SDI), you may be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of partial pay through California PFL when you need time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, or registered domestic partner). The California Employment Development Department (EDD) handles PFL claims, and benefits are typically 60-70% of your usual wages. Please refer to the EDD website (edd.ca.gov) for the most up-to-date information. Note that PFL benefits are capped based on limits set by the state.\n\n**Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** The federal FMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for your own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least twelve (12) months, have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before your leave starts, and work at a location where Acme Corp has 50 or more employees within 75 miles.\n\n**Coordination of PFL and FMLA:** Because California PFL and federal FMLA may run concurrently, eligible employees may take up to 12 weeks for a qualifying event. Acme Corp will designate leave as FMLA-qualifying if the reason for the leave qualifies under FMLA. When an employee is approved for PFL, we will determine their eligibility for FMLA and notify them if their PFL leave also qualifies as FMLA leave. Although FMLA leave is unpaid, PFL provides partial wage replacement for up to 8 weeks of the FMLA leave period if all conditions are met.\n\nIf your leave request is not for parental bonding and the leave.duration_weeks is less than 3 weeks then paid leave is not provided.\n\nEmployees must request leave at least 30 days in advance or as soon as practicable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If you are a California employee who contributes to State Disability Insurance (SDI), you may be eligible for up to eight (8) weeks of partial pay through California PFL when you need time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Eligibility for federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least twelve (12) months, have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before your leave starts, and work at a location where Acme Corp has 50 or more employees within 75 miles.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_pfl_concurrent_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.leave_type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"medical\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"Potential concurrent use of PFL and FMLA\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Because California PFL and federal FMLA may run concurrently, eligible employees may take up to 12 weeks for a qualifying event.

SparkleTech is committed to complying with all applicable California labor laws, however, it is ultimately the employee\u2019s responsibility to notify their supervisor if they believe their break was missed or interrupted so we can investigate the incident. This policy applies to all non-exempt employees working in California. Exempt employees are not subject to these break requirements. See Section 2.1 of this handbook for the definition of 'exempt' vs. 'non-exempt' employee classifications.\n\nGenerally, if a non-exempt employee works more than five (5) hours in a workday, they are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. If an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday, a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break is required. These meal breaks must be taken such that the employee is completely relieved of all duties. It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure that they are taking their mandatory meal breaks, and that the supervisor approves breaks with overlapping coverage.\n\nAdditionally, non-exempt employees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, if feasible, be scheduled in the middle of the four-hour work period. However, under extenuating circumstances, rest breaks can be adjusted. Although SparkleTech encourages all eligible employees to take their legally-protected rest breaks, we will deem an employee to have waived their right to a rest break if it is not taken, and there is no record or notification to the supervisor of a denied rest break. Repeated failure to take rest breaks, even if no work is performed during that time, can be considered as a failure to perform assigned duties and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination, if this action is observed repeatedly without explanation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_missed_breaks_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Disciplinary action up to and including termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Repeated failure to take rest breaks, even if no work is performed during that time, can be considered as a failure to perform assigned duties and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination, if this action is observed repeatedly without explanation.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_missed_breaks_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employee to notify their supervisor if they believe their break was missed or interrupted\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"however, it is ultimately the employee\\u2019s responsibility to notify their supervisor if they believe their break was missed or interrupted so we can investigate the incident.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"SparkleTech Solutions Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "termination"}}

A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees.

Notices will be provided to affected employees or their representatives (if any), the State Rapid Response Coordinator, and the chief elected official of the local government. For the purposes of this policy, \"part-time employee\" means an employee who is employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week or who has been employed for fewer than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is required.

This policy should be read in conjunction with Policy 2.1 (Employee Separation) and Policy 4.5 (Payroll Procedures).\n\nFor employees who are involuntarily terminated, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination are due and payable immediately at the time of discharge. This includes, but is not limited to, accrued vacation time as described in Policy 5.3 (Vacation Accrual and Usage). If an employee resigns, the timing of the final paycheck is contingent on the notice period provided. If an employee provides at least 72 hours\u2019 notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment. Conversely, should an employee resign without providing at least 72 hours of notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the resignation. Note that if the employee's final day falls on a weekend or holiday, the paycheck may be available on the next business day; however, the company is committed to doing all we can to deliver the final paycheck immediately and will do so unless there is an unforeseen operational issue. Employees who are laid off will receive their final paycheck on their final day of employment in most cases; however, in a mass layoff situation (as defined in Policy 2.1), due to administrative complexities, the paycheck may be issued within 72 hours. Any discrepancies or concerns regarding the final paycheck should be reported to the HR Department within 10 business days of receipt. This policy supersedes any previous verbal or written communication regarding final paycheck distribution."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_involuntary_termination\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"terminated\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"involuntary\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck distribution\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"immediately\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For employees who are involuntarily terminated, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination are due and payable immediately at the time of discharge.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_resignation_72_hour_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"resigned\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck distribution\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"last day of employment\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee provides at least 72 hours\\u2019 notice of their resignation, their final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_resignation_less_than_72_hour_notice\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"resigned\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_given\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": false\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"termination.notice_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 72\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck distribution\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"within 72 hours of the resignation\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Conversely, should an employee resign without providing at least 72 hours of notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the resignation.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"final_pay_layoff_mass_layoff_exception\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"laid_off\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"mass_layoff\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"Final paycheck distribution\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"timeframe\": \"within 72 hours\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who are laid off will receive their final paycheck on their final day of employment in most cases; however, in a mass layoff situation (as defined in Policy 2.1), due to administrative complexities, the paycheck may be issued within 72 hours.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Sterling Consolidated HR Policy Manual\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "final_paycheck", "rule_type": "leave"}}

This policy outlines the procedures Acme Corp will follow in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff that may trigger the requirements of the federal WARN Act. For purposes of this policy, a \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force resulting in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, provided that the number of employees who suffer employment losses constitutes at least 33 percent of the employees at the single site of employment. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees.\n\nIn the event that Acme Corp anticipates a plant closing or mass layoff that meets the criteria outlined above, the company will provide affected employees with written notice at least 60 calendar days in advance of the date of the plant closing or mass layoff, to the extent required by federal WARN Act. This notice will include information about the expected date of termination, whether the termination is expected to be permanent or temporary, and information regarding benefits continuation and re-employment assistance. While Acme Corp strives to provide as much notice as possible, situations may arise where providing 60 days' notice is not feasible due to unforeseen business circumstances. In such cases, Acme Corp will comply with the \"unforeseeable business circumstances\" exception under the federal WARN Act. This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees in the United States.

As such, specific state or local break laws may not apply. Employees are responsible for familiarizing themselves with and adhering to the guidelines outlined below.\n\n**Meal Breaks:** Employees are eligible for a 30-minute unpaid meal break when their work shift exceeds six (6) hours. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to record their meal break accurately in the company timekeeping system. If an employee voluntarily chooses to work through their meal break and their shift is longer than six (6) hours, and they are reported as having not taken a break, that employee is subject to termination. Continued violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees working less than six (6) hours are not eligible for a meal break.\n\n**Rest Breaks:** While not required by federal law, Acme Corp. allows a paid 10-minute rest break for employees who work a full eight (8) hour shift, or at least 4 consecutive hours. Employees who miss multiple rest breaks during their shift without prior approval may be subject to disciplinary action. The timekeeping system must accurately reflect all breaks taken. Deliberate falsification of time records will result in immediate termination.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to utilize break times for personal needs such as relaxation, hydration, or communication. Breaks should be taken away from the employee\u2019s workstation whenever possible. All employee conduct during breaks must adhere to the company\u2019s Code of Conduct.\n\n**Policy Exceptions:** In the event of an emergency or unforeseen business needs, a manager may require an employee to return to work from a meal or rest break.\n\n**Cross-Reference:** See Section 2.12: Timekeeping Policy and Section 4.1: Code of Conduct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_meal_break_violation\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"shift.duration_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"meal\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee voluntarily chooses to work through their meal break and their shift is longer than six (6) hours, and they are reported as having not taken a break, that employee is subject to termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_timekeeping_falsification\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"meal\",\n            \"rest\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Deliberate falsification of time records will result in immediate termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"disciplinary_action_rest_break_violation\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"shift.duration_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"rest\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"disciplinary action\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who miss multiple rest breaks during their shift without prior approval may be subject to disciplinary action.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "meal_breaks", "rule_type": "termination"}}

We strive to comply with both California law and federal law, offering employees the best possible leave options within the legal framework.\n\n**3.5.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nEmployees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) and work in California are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). This benefit provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of your normal wages) for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling) or to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement). See Section 3.5.4 for concurrent FMLA and PFL leave provisions. An employee will not be terminated if their employment status is active and SDI contributions are being made. If the employee contributes to SDI, and is actively employed, they will not be terminated for using PFL as defined in this section.\n\n**3.5.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law providing eligible employees of Sterling Consolidated (where we have 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite) with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for specified family and medical reasons. These reasons include the birth or adoption of a child; to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent); or due to the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job.\n\n**3.5.3 Leave Coordination**\n\nTo the extent possible, Sterling Consolidated will coordinate California PFL and FMLA leave. Leave taken under California PFL will run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement when the leave qualifies for both. This means that the 8 weeks of PFL are part of, not in addition to, the 12 weeks allowed under FMLA.\n\n**3.5.4 Termination during Leave**\n\nSterling Consolidated may consider termination during an active FMLA or PFL leave period if the employee's employment status changes from active to something else. For example, if an entire department is eliminated due to restructuring and the employee's role is eliminated, and that would lead to termination regardless of leave status, the employee\u2019s employment may be terminated during the FMLA/PFL leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) and work in California are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_pfl_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"family\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"termination of employment\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"An employee will not be terminated if their employment status is active and SDI contributions are being made.

Note that the definition of \"affected employee\" also includes employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an employment loss as a result of the layoff or closure. For employees with less than six months of continuous service, notice may be provided if the layoff is planned during their first 6 months.

This policy outlines the requirements for overtime compensation for eligible employees. For the purposes of this policy, \"overtime\" is defined as any hours actually worked exceeding forty (40) hours in a single workweek, as further described in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207. Overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay, though certain employees and situations may be excluded from overtime eligibility under the FLSA, as determined by the company and in accordance with legal requirements.\n\nEmployees classified as non-exempt under the FLSA are eligible for overtime compensation. In the event that a non-exempt employee works more than 40 hours in a workweek, they will be paid overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for each hour exceeding 40. Further, if an employee\u2019s employment status shifts from terminated to active or from resigned to active within the same workweek, any hours worked prior to the change in status will not be considered when calculating any overtime entitlement.

This policy specifically addresses our obligations under the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the Federal WARN Act. This policy applies only to employees working in California.\n\n**3.12.1. California WARN Act Requirements:**\n\nIf Acme Corp has 75 or more employees (as defined by the California WARN Act) and plans a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period at a single site of employment, we are required to provide written notice to affected employees at least 60 days in advance. \"Mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closure or relocation and results in employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. This notice must be provided to the affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local chief elected official. The specific contents of the notice must comply with the requirements of the California WARN Act (California Labor Code Sections 1400 et seq.).\n\n**3.12.2. Federal WARN Act Requirements:**\n\nIndependently of the California WARN Act, and in addition to the requirements above, if Acme Corp has 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees, and plans a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, we must provide 60 days\u2019 advance written notice. A \"plant closing\" is the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees. A \"mass layoff\" under the federal law is slightly different from California's and is defined as a reduction in force not resulting from a plant closing and results in employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees, if those 50 employees represent at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment.\n\n**3.12.3. Notification Obligations:**\n\nIn the event that either the California WARN Act or the Federal WARN Act is triggered, Acme Corp's HR department, in coordination with Legal Counsel, will be responsible for ensuring that all required notices are provided in a timely and accurate manner. Failure to comply with either the state or federal WARN Act can result in significant penalties.\n\n**3.12.4 Definitions:**\n\n*   \"Single site of employment\" means one or more facilities or operating units which are located within the same geographic area and share the same staff and equipment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_ca_trigger\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice of mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If Acme Corp has 75 or more employees (as defined by the California WARN Act) and plans a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure that affects 50 or more employees within a 30-day period at a single site of employment, we are required to provide written notice to affected employees at least 60 days in advance.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_federal_trigger\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days\\u2019 advance written notice of plant closing or mass layoff\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"if Acme Corp has 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees, and plans a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, we must provide 60 days\\u2019 advance written notice.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_notification_obligation\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 75\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.timeframe_days\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 30\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local chief elected official\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"This notice must be provided to the affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the local chief elected official.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Layoff Notification Policy (WARN Act Compliance)\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}, "spec_summary": {"topic": "warn", "rule_type": "entitlement"}}

Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1408, concerning mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations that affect employees working in California. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in other Mammoth Industries policies, the provisions outlined herein shall govern compliance with state and federal WARN Act requirements specifically as applied to employees whose primary work location is within the state of California.\n\n3.12.2. **Notice Requirements.** In the event of a plant closing, mass layoff, or relocation, as defined under both the federal and California WARN Acts, Mammoth Industries shall provide advance written notice to affected employees, the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), and any applicable local government as mandated by law. For purposes of determining applicability of the California WARN Act, the threshold number of employees is seventy-five (75), as dictated by California Labor Code section 1400, notwithstanding the federal threshold of one hundred (100) employees.\n\n3.12.3. **California Specific Provisions.** If a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation occurs in California and affects fifty (50) or more employees within a thirty (30)-day period at a single site of employment, the Company shall provide sixty (60) calendar days' advance written notice, as required under California Labor Code \u00a7 1401. This requirement applies irrespective of the total number of employees employed by Mammoth Industries nationally, so long as the number of employees working within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of the California site of employment is equal to or exceeds seventy-five (75). The notice shall contain all information required under both federal and California law. However, where the federal WARN act requires 100 employees to trigger, that requirement does not supersede the California standard of 75 employees within a 75-mile radius of the affected worksite.\n\n3.12.4. **Exceptions.** There may be unforeseen circumstances where the aforementioned sixty (60)-day notice period cannot be adhered to.

This section outlines our Family and Medical Leave policies, which incorporate both federal and California state regulations. Eligibility for leave, duration, and pay (if applicable) are dependent on several factors, including your work location, length of service, and contribution to California State Disability Insurance (SDI).\n\n**3.4.1 Family and Medical Leave Eligibility**\n\nGenerally, to be eligible for unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), a federal law, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date your leave is to commence. Further, Acme Corp must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite. FMLA provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for qualifying reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for your own serious health condition as defined by the FMLA statute.\n\nHowever, employees who work in California and contribute to SDI may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). California PFL provides partial wage replacement benefits, currently between 60% and 70% of your usual wages, for up to 8 weeks, to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. Note that eligibility for PFL may depend on whether you contribute to SDI, and you must meet the SDI eligibility requirements. Simultaneous utilization of both FMLA and PFL may be possible, running concurrently, where the leave qualifies under both laws, subject to normal HR approval processes. An employee that is in 'active' employment status may qualify for the leave and should contact their manager to determine qualification.\n\nEmployees who are unsure of their eligibility for either FMLA or PFL should contact the HR department for clarification.

This policy outlines Acme Corp.'s obligations and procedures in the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation that triggers the notification requirements under the federal WARN Act.\n\n**3.7.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nIn accordance with the federal WARN Act, Acme Corp. will provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees before a plant closing or mass layoff occurs. For the purposes of this policy, a \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for either (1) 500 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees; or (2) 50-499 employees, excluding any part-time employees, if the number of employees who suffer employment loss represents at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment. Part-time employee means an employee who is employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week or who has been employed for fewer than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is required.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, if the total number of company employees is fewer than 100, then no notice is required pursuant to this Section 3.7.1. Furthermore, if the layoffs occur over a period longer than 30 days, but less than 90 days, these layoffs may also trigger WARN requirements if, cumulatively, they meet the threshold. See also Policy 3.7.2 for details on calculating employee counts.\n\n**3.7.2 Employee Count Calculation**\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether Acme Corp. meets the employee threshold for WARN Act applicability, the total number of employees will be calculated based on the number of active employees, excluding employees on temporary layoff, at the time the decision to implement a mass layoff or plant closure is made."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice to affected employees before a plant closing or mass layoff occurs\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In accordance with the federal WARN Act, Acme Corp. will provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees before a plant closing or mass layoff occurs.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"mass_layoff\",\n            \"plant_closure\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 500\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"60 days advance written notice to affected employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"A \\\"mass layoff\\\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing, and results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for either (1) 500 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_notice_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"lt\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"WARN act notice\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Notwithstanding the above, if the total number of company employees is fewer than 100, then no notice is required pursuant to this Section 3.7.1.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This policy is designed to comply with both federal and California state law; however, the provisions of California law shall govern the calculation of overtime pay for employees whose primary work location is within the State of California, pursuant to California Labor Code Sections 510 and 515. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all overtime compensation will be calculated based on the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.\n\n3.  4.  2 Overtime Calculation\n\na. Federal Standard: For non-exempt employees whose primary work location is outside of California, or where federal law provides a greater benefit to the employee, overtime shall be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.\n\nb. California Standard: For non-exempt employees whose primary work location is within the State of California, overtime compensation shall be calculated as follows. Employees shall be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday, or for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. Employees shall be paid at two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday, or for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of work in a workweek. It is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked. For employees with tenure less than 3 months, daily overtime calculation shall be based only on hours worked beyond 12 in a day.\n\n3.  4.  3. Approval Requirement\n    No employee may work overtime without the prior authorization of their supervisor. Any unauthorized overtime will not be compensated unless explicitly approved ex post facto by the employee\u2019s manager in coordination with the Human Resources department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_overtime_after_8_hours\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Overtime pay at 1.5x regular rate for hours worked over 8 in a workday\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"overtime_rate\": 1.5\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For non-exempt employees whose primary work location is within the State of California, overtime compensation shall be calculated as follows.

This policy outlines the procedures for mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations affecting employees working in California, specifically addressing requirements under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and the California WARN Act. This policy supplements, and does not supersede, any existing collective bargaining agreements.\n\n**3.12.1 Notice Requirements**\n\nIn the event of a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation, Acme Corp will provide written notice to affected employees and relevant government entities as required by law. For employees whose employee.location_state is CA, the following conditions apply:\n\n*   **California WARN Act Applicability:** If Acme Corp's employer.employee_count_within_75_miles equals or exceeds 75 employees, and the layoff affects 50 or more employees at a single site of employment within a 30-day period due to a layoff.type of mass_layoff, plant_closure, or relocation, a 60-day advance written notice will be provided to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local workforce investment boards.\n*   **Federal WARN Act Applicability:** Even if the California WARN Act is not triggered due to workforce size within 75 miles, if Acme Corp's employer.employee_count equals or exceeds 100 employees, excluding part-time employees, and the layoff.affected_employee_count is 50 or more employees at a single site of employment during a 30-day period, the Federal WARN Act requires a 60-day advance written notice to be provided.

This policy outlines the company\u2019s procedures regarding plant closings and mass layoffs. As a general guideline, the company endeavors to provide as much advance notice as practicable to affected employees in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff.\n\n(a) **Notice Requirement**. In accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq., Veridian Dynamics will provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees before any plant closing or mass layoff as defined under Federal Law. A *plant closing* means the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A *mass layoff* means a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for (A) 500 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees, or (B) 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees, if the number of employees who suffer employment loss represents 33 percent or more of the employees at the single site of employment. For purposes of determining whether this notification requirement is triggered, the number of employees at a single site of employment shall be determined according to the number of employees active at such single site in the pay period immediately preceeding notice. This policy applies to employees in all US locations, but follows only Federal requirements.\n\n(b) **Exemptions**. This policy and its notification requirement does not apply to temporary cessation of business activities that are the result of strikes and labor disputes.\n\n(c) **Coordination with Other Policies**.

An employee whose location_state is California and who contributes to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) may be eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for up to eight (8) weeks. Such leave shall be granted for the purposes of bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member, as defined under California law. However, if an employee's tenure_months is less than twelve (12) months as of the commencement of the requested leave, or if the employee has previously exhausted their allotted FMLA leave within the rolling twelve (12) month period, any leave exceeding a cumulative total of four (4) weeks, even if otherwise qualifying under PFL, shall constitute a voluntary resignation of employment effective the end of the 4th week of leave. For avoidance of doubt, this policy does *not* prohibit employees from being terminated for other reasons.\n\n3.2.3 Where the employee.location_state is California and the employer.employee_count_within_75_miles is greater than 50, The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period. The leave duration_weeks shall be counted concurrently with any PFL leave. Employees seeking leave for bonding or childcare purposes are required to follow the guidelines outlined in Section 3.2.2. Failure to return to work, pursuant to section 3.2.2, after exceeding the four week threshold constitutes a voluntary termination.\n\n3.2.4 Ardent Industries reserves the right to request certification from a healthcare provider to substantiate the need for leave related to a serious health condition.

This policy governs the timing of final wage payments for employees whose primary work location is within the State of California. Notwithstanding any other provision in this manual, this section supersedes any conflicting federal policies regarding final wage payment timing for California-based employees.\n\n3.12.2 **Involuntary Termination**. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 201, if an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp., all wages earned and unpaid at the time of termination shall be due and payable immediately at the time of discharge. The final paycheck must include all earned wages, including accrued and unused vacation time, pursuant to Acme Corp. Policy 4.02 regarding Vacation Accrual and Usage. This requirement for immediate payment is not applicable if the employee's employment status is not 'terminated', for example, if they are on a leave of absence, including but not limited to family, medical, or parental leave, as defined in Section 5.01.\n\n3.12.3 **Voluntary Resignation**. Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 202, if an employee voluntarily resigns from Acme Corp., the timing of the final wage payment depends on the amount of notice provided. If the employee provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, the final wages are due and payable at the time of resignation. However, if the employee fails to provide at least 72 hours' notice, final wages are due and payable within 72 hours of the employee's last day of work. An employee's resignation does not constitute an involuntary termination.\n\n3.12.4 **Method of Payment**. All final paychecks will be disbursed in accordance with Acme Corp.'s standard payroll practices.

For employees working outside of California, please refer to Section 3.15 for information on final paychecks.\n\nNovaTech Solutions is committed to complying with all applicable California Labor Code requirements regarding final pay. Generally, upon termination of employment, an employee's final wages are due and payable immediately. However, the specific timing of final pay depends on the circumstances of the termination.\n\n*   **Involuntary Termination:** If an employee is involuntarily terminated from NovaTech Solutions, their final paycheck, encompassing all earned and unpaid wages, including accrued but unused vacation time as per policy Section 4.2, will be made available to them immediately upon termination. Note that if an employee has been working outside of California at any point in the last 12 months, and has accumulated more than 1200 hours of work in the past year across any number of work locations not including California, the regular payroll schedule will be followed. This exception does not apply if the employee has spent a majority of their tenure with NovaTech Solutions working inside California. Final checks will be available at the employee\u2019s regular work location on the day of termination.\n\n*   **Voluntary Termination (Resignation):** If an employee voluntarily resigns from NovaTech Solutions, the timing of their final paycheck depends on the amount of notice provided. In instances where the employee provides at least 72 hours' advance notice of their resignation, the final paycheck will be available on their last day of employment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Acme Corp.'s total U.S. employee count is less than one hundred (100), the requirements of this section shall not apply.

Overtime pay is required for all non-exempt employees who work more than forty (40) hours in a workweek. For the purposes of this policy, a workweek is defined as a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours, or seven consecutive 24-hour periods, as designated by the employee's department. Notwithstanding any departmental designations, for the purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek commences at 12:00 AM on Sunday and concludes at 11:59 PM on Saturday.\n\n**3.4.2 Overtime Rate**\n\nNon-exempt employees shall receive compensation for overtime hours at a rate not less than one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for each hour worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek. Note that this provision is applied consistently across all OmniCorp Solutions locations within the United States, irrespective of conflicting state-level regulations, which shall not apply under this policy.\n\n**3.4.3 Exclusions and Special Cases**\n\nThis policy applies exclusively to non-exempt employees as classified under the FLSA. Employees classified as exempt are not eligible for overtime compensation. Moreover, this policy applies only to active employees. If an employee is in a terminated, resigned, or laid off status, they are not eligible to receive overtime compensation even if they were in an eligible status during the workweek for which the overtime would be calculated.

Furthermore, all overtime work must be pre-authorized by the employee's direct supervisor, or a designated member of management. Any overtime hours worked without prior authorization may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The determination as to whether unauthorized overtime will be compensated rests solely with the discretion of Apex Dynamic Solutions management. Furthermore, any hours that are deemed un-authorized may not be compensated even if those hours exceed 40 in any given work week. It is the employee's responsibility to track all hours worked and to accurately report those hours on their timesheet.\n\n**3.4.3 Computation of Overtime Pay**\n\nOvertime pay shall be calculated based on the employee's regular rate of pay, as defined by the FLSA. This includes not only the employee's hourly wage but also any non-discretionary bonuses, commissions, or other forms of compensation that are considered part of the employee's regular rate.

While federal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks, we recognize the importance of providing opportunities for employees to refresh and recharge during their workday. This policy outlines our approach to meal and rest breaks for all employees within the United States, adhering to federal guidelines only, regardless of state or local laws.\n\n**3.4.1 Paid Rest Breaks:** For non-exempt employees, Acme Corp. will provide a paid rest break of 10 minutes for every four (4) hours of work. This means if your shift is four hours or longer, you are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break. If the shift is less than 4 hours, no rest break is provided. If your hours worked daily exceed 8, you are entitled to a second 10-minute paid rest break. These rest breaks are considered time worked and must be paid. Employees are expected to remain on company premises during paid rest breaks, unless approved by their manager.\n\n**3.4.2 Unpaid Meal Breaks:** For non-exempt employees, Acme Corp. provides an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes for employees who work more than six (6) hours in a workday. During this meal break, the employee must be completely relieved of all duties. This means you should not be performing any work-related tasks, answering emails, or taking phone calls during your meal break. If an employee works 10 or fewer hours, only one unpaid meal break is offered. If an employee works more than 10 hours but fewer than 12, a second unpaid meal break is offered. Employees are not required to remain on company premises during unpaid meal breaks.\n\n**3.4.3. Compliance:** It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to take their afforded break and to accurately record these breaks in our timekeeping system (See Section 3.5 Timekeeping Procedures)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"paid_rest_break_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"entitlement\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 4\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"paid rest break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"rest\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For non-exempt employees, Acme Corp. will provide a paid rest break of 10 minutes for every four (4) hours of work.

This policy applies exclusively to California-based employees.\n\n**Notification Requirements:**\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to providing advance notice of qualifying plant closings, mass layoffs, or relocations as required by law. We understand the impact such events have on our employees and strive to provide as much notice as possible while remaining compliant.\n\n1.  **California WARN Act Applicability:** The California WARN Act applies if Acme Corp. employs 75 or more employees within California. If a mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation affects 50 or more California employees within a 30-day period, the California WARN Act requires a 60-day advance written notice to affected employees, the California Employment Development Department (EDD), and local government officials. See California Labor Code Sections 1400-1408.\n\n2.  **Federal WARN Act Applicability:** The Federal WARN Act applies if Acme Corp. employs 100 or more employees. In the event of a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment, a 60-day advance written notice is generally required.\n\n3.  **Triggering Events:** A \"mass layoff\" under California law means a layoff during any 30-day period of 50 or more employees at a covered establishment. A \"plant closure\" means the shutdown of a single site of employment resulting in an employment loss of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.

Please note that this policy is governed by California state law, which may differ from federal regulations. (See also Section 1.4: State Law Variations).\n\nAcme Corp complies with California Labor Code requirements for overtime compensation. Non-exempt employees in California are entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked beyond eight (8) hours in a single workday, or for more than forty (40) hours in a workweek. Overtime compensation will be paid at one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For example, if your regular hourly rate is $20/hour, your overtime rate would be $30/hour.\n\nFurthermore, California law requires double-time compensation for any hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in a single workday. Double-time is also required for any hours worked beyond eight (8) on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of a workweek. In these instances, employees will be paid at two (2) times their regular rate of pay.\n\nIt is the employee\u2019s responsibility to accurately record all hours worked, including overtime hours, on their timesheet. Supervisors are responsible for approving all timesheets and ensuring that overtime hours are accurately recorded and paid in accordance with this policy. Failure to accurately record hours worked may result in disciplinary action.
