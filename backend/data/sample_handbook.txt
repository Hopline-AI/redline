SECTION 1: WELCOME & COMPANY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Welcome to Acme Technologies Inc. ("Acme" or "the Company"). We are a California-
based software company headquartered in San Jose, California, with approximately
200 employees across three offices in the San Francisco Bay Area. This Employee
Handbook sets forth the policies and procedures that govern your employment with
Acme Technologies. All employees are expected to read, understand, and comply with
the policies contained herein.

This handbook applies to all employees working in the state of California. Nothing
in this handbook is intended to create a contract of employment. Employment with
Acme Technologies is at-will, meaning either the employee or the Company may
terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice,
subject to the procedures described in this handbook.

This handbook supersedes all prior handbooks, policies, and practices. The Company
reserves the right to modify, amend, or discontinue any policy at any time.

================================================================================

2.1 EMPLOYEE CATEGORIES

Acme Technologies classifies employees into the following categories for purposes
of compensation, benefits eligibility, and compliance with applicable laws:

  (a) Full-Time Employees: Employees who are regularly scheduled to work 40 or
      more hours per week. Full-time employees are eligible for all Company
      benefits described in this handbook.

  (b) Part-Time Employees: Employees who are regularly scheduled to work fewer
      than 40 hours per week. Part-time employees working 20 or more hours per
      week are eligible for limited benefits as described in Section 8.

      not to exceed six months. Temporary employees are not eligible for Company
      benefits.

2.2 EXEMPT AND NON-EXEMPT STATUS

Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) and California law:

  (a) Exempt Employees: Employees who meet the criteria for exemption from
      overtime requirements under federal and state law. Exempt employees are
      paid on a salary basis and are not eligible for overtime pay.

  (b) Non-Exempt Employees: Employees who are entitled to overtime pay in
      accordance with the Company's overtime policy as described in Section 3.

3.2 OVERTIME POLICY

Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime compensation as follows:

  (a) Weekly Overtime: Non-exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a

      times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours.

      Unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action, though the

      number of hours worked.

  (d) For purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek begins on Monday at
      12:00 a.m. and ends on Sunday at 11:59 p.m.

3.3 ON-CALL AND STANDBY PAY

Employees required to remain on Company premises or within a restricted area
during on-call periods will be compensated at their regular hourly rate for all
on-call hours. Employees who are free to leave the premises and use their time
for personal purposes while on call will not be compensated for on-call time
unless called in to work.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: WORK SCHEDULES, MEAL PERIODS & REST BREAKS
================================================================================

4.1 STANDARD WORK SCHEDULE

The standard work schedule for full-time employees is Monday through Friday,
9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., with a 30-minute lunch break. Alternative schedules may
be arranged with supervisor approval. During peak project periods, employees may
be required to work extended hours, including weekends, as business needs dictate.

4.2 MEAL PERIODS

All non-exempt employees working more than six (6) hours in a workday are
entitled to one unpaid meal period of twenty (20) minutes. The meal period
should be taken approximately midway through the shift. During the meal period,
employees are relieved of all duties and are free to leave the premises.

Employees working shifts of ten (10) hours or longer are encouraged, but not
required, to take a second meal break at a time agreed upon with their supervisor.

4.3 REST BREAKS

Non-exempt employees are entitled to one paid rest break of ten (10) minutes for
each four (4) hours of work, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be
taken as close to the middle of each work period as practicable.

4.4 LACTATION ACCOMMODATION

The Company provides reasonable break time and a private space (other than a
bathroom) for employees who need to express breast milk for their infant child,
in accordance with California law.

================================================================================

annual accrual rate. Upon termination, accrued but unused PTO will be paid out
at the employee's final regular rate of pay.

5.2 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE

Acme Technologies provides family and medical leave to eligible employees in
accordance with applicable law. To be eligible for family and medical leave,
an employee must:

  (a) Have been employed by the Company for at least eighteen (18) months; and
  (b) Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) months preceding
      the start of the leave; and
  (c) Work at a location where the Company employs at least 50 employees within
      a 75-mile radius.

Eligible employees may take up to eight (8) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave

  (a) The birth of a child and to bond with the newborn;
  (b) The placement of a child for adoption or foster care;
  (c) To care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition;
  (d) A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the
      essential functions of their job.

During approved family and medical leave, the Company will maintain the employee's
group health insurance coverage under the same terms as if the employee had
continued to work.

5.3 CALIFORNIA PAID FAMILY LEAVE

The Company acknowledges that California employees may be eligible for Paid Family
Leave (PFL) benefits through the state Employment Development Department (EDD).
PFL provides partial wage replacement of up to fifty percent (50%) of the

to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member.

PFL benefits are funded entirely through employee payroll deductions to the State
Disability Insurance (SDI) program. Employees must apply directly to the EDD for
PFL benefits. The Company does not administer PFL benefits.

Employees may use accrued PTO concurrently with PFL benefits, but the combined
total shall not exceed 100% of the employee's regular weekly salary.

5.4 SICK LEAVE

In accordance with California's Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act, all
employees (including part-time and temporary employees) accrue paid sick leave
at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours
per year. Sick leave may be used beginning on the 90th day of employment.

5.5 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE

parent, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild).

their final paycheck, including all earned wages and accrued PTO payout, within
five (5) business days of the termination date.

limited to laptops, access badges, keys, and any confidential materials. Failure
to return Company property may result in deductions from the final paycheck to
the extent permitted by law.

are voluntary but encouraged, as they help the Company improve workplace policies
and practices.
