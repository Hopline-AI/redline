Welcome to Acme Technologies Inc. ("Acme" or "the Company"). We are a California-
based software company headquartered in San Jose, California, with approximately

Handbook sets forth the policies and procedures that govern your employment with
Acme Technologies. All employees are expected to read, understand, and comply with
the policies contained herein.

This handbook applies to all employees working in the state of California. Nothing
in this handbook is intended to create a contract of employment. Employment with
Acme Technologies is at-will, meaning either the employee or the Company may
terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice,
subject to the procedures described in this handbook.

This handbook supersedes all prior handbooks, policies, and practices. The Company
reserves the right to modify, amend, or discontinue any policy at any time.

      times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours.

for personal purposes while on call will not be compensated for on-call time
unless called in to work.
