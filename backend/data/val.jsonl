This policy outlines our procedures regarding workforce reductions, including mass layoffs and plant closures, and aims to comply with both federal and California law regarding advance notice.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements:**\n\nAcme Co. is required to provide advance written notice to affected employees in the event of a qualifying mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. A \"mass layoff\" under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101, et seq., is defined as a reduction in force (excluding terminations for cause, voluntary departures, or retirements) that results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 employees represent at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees regardless of percentage. Under California's WARN Act, Cal. Labor Code sections 1400 et seq., a mass layoff is defined as the termination of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.\n\n**3.12.2 Notice Period:**\n\nIf Acme Co. employs 100 or more employees (nationwide), and a mass layoff or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees is planned, the company must provide at least 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees, their representatives (if any), the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), and the chief elected official of the local government. If the company employs 75 or more employees in California, and a mass layoff or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees occurs in California, the company must comply with California WARN regulations, providing 60 days' notice as described above. In situations where the employee is located in California, Acme Co. will always apply the California WARN act requirements.

We strive to comply with both California law and federal law, offering employees the best possible leave options within the legal framework.\n\n**3.5.1 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nEmployees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) and work in California are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). This benefit provides partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of your normal wages) for up to 8 weeks to care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling) or to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement). See Section 3.5.4 for concurrent FMLA and PFL leave provisions. An employee will not be terminated if their employment status is active and SDI contributions are being made. If the employee contributes to SDI, and is actively employed, they will not be terminated for using PFL as defined in this section.\n\n**3.5.2 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law providing eligible employees of Sterling Consolidated (where we have 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite) with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for specified family and medical reasons. These reasons include the birth or adoption of a child; to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent); or due to the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job.\n\n**3.5.3 Leave Coordination**\n\nTo the extent possible, Sterling Consolidated will coordinate California PFL and FMLA leave. Leave taken under California PFL will run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement when the leave qualifies for both. This means that the 8 weeks of PFL are part of, not in addition to, the 12 weeks allowed under FMLA.\n\n**3.5.4 Termination during Leave**\n\nSterling Consolidated may consider termination during an active FMLA or PFL leave period if the employee's employment status changes from active to something else. For example, if an entire department is eliminated due to restructuring and the employee's role is eliminated, and that would lead to termination regardless of leave status, the employee\u2019s employment may be terminated during the FMLA/PFL leave."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI) and work in California are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"termination_pfl_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"family\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"termination of employment\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"An employee will not be terminated if their employment status is active and SDI contributions are being made.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.4: Meal and Rest Breaks**\n**Effective Date: 2024-07-01**\n**Revision: 2.0**\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to providing its employees with legally compliant meal and rest breaks. This policy outlines the company\u2019s requirements regarding these breaks, considering both federal and California state laws.\n\n**3.4.1 General Provisions**\n\nFederal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, if Acme Corp. chooses to provide short breaks (5 to 20 minutes), these breaks must be paid. Meal breaks of 30 minutes or more are generally unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties during the break. In California, however, the law requires very specific provisions regarding meal and rest breaks.\n\n**3.4.2 California Specific Provisions**\n\nEmployees working in California are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break if they work more than five (5) hours in a workday. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Additionally, California employees are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. It is the employee\u2019s responsibility to take these breaks. If a non-exempt employee works in California and their shift hours are greater than 5, AND they are *not* classified as exempt, then they are eligible for an unpaid 30 minute meal break. Please consult the \u201cExempt vs. Non-Exempt Classification\u201d section of this handbook (Section 2.2) for further clarification on employee classifications.\n\n**3.4.3 Break Waivers**\n\nUnder certain circumstances, California employees may waive their meal breaks. Please see Section 3.5 for more information on meal break waivers.\n\n**3.4.4 Missed Breaks**\n\nAny employee who is required to work through their meal break or rest break due to business necessity must immediately notify their supervisor. Acme Corp will provide compensation in accordance with California law for missed breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"exempt\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"unpaid 30 minute meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a non-exempt employee works in California and their shift hours are greater than 5, AND they are *not* classified as exempt, then they are eligible for an unpaid 30 minute meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

This policy outlines the procedures for mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, ensuring that we provide adequate notice to affected employees. This policy applies to all Apex Corporation employees in the United States.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nThe Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires employers to provide advance notice of certain plant closings and mass layoffs. A \"plant closing\" is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. A \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for either (1) 50 or more employees if they make up at least 33% of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment; or (2) 500 or more employees, regardless of the percentage of the employer's active workforce at the single site of employment. \"Employment loss\" is generally defined as a termination, a layoff exceeding six months, or a reduction in hours of more than 50 percent during each month of any six-month period.\n\n**3.12.2 California WARN Act Considerations**\n\nIn addition to the federal WARN Act, Apex Corporation acknowledges that California has its own version of the WARN Act, often referred to as the California WARN Act. The California WARN Act applies to employers with 75 or more employees (both full-time and part-time) and requires 60 days' advance written notice before a mass layoff, relocation, or plant closure affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.\n\nTherefore, if Apex Corporation has 75 or more employees within California, and a layoff will impact 50 or more employees, affected employees are entitled to 60 days' notice of the layoff.

Any exceptions to this policy must be approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources and General Counsel.\n\n3.14.2 Involuntary Termination: Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 201, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, if an employee.location_state is 'CA' and employee.employment_status is 'terminated' through involuntary termination, the employee\u2019s final paycheck, encompassing all wages earned and accrued vacation time, shall be made available to the employee immediately upon termination.\n\n3.14.3 Voluntary Resignation: For employees who voluntarily resign from Acme Corp., the timing of the final paycheck will depend on the amount of notice provided. If an employee.location_state is 'CA' and employee.employment_status is 'resigned', and termination.notice_given is 'true' with termination.notice_hours equal to or greater than 72, the final paycheck shall be made available on the employee\u2019s last day of employment. If termination.notice_hours is less than 72 hours, Acme Corp. shall make the final paycheck available to the employee within 72 hours of their last day of employment.

Unified Global Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) is committed to conducting workforce reductions, including mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, specifically the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (\"WARN Act,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.). This Section 3.12 outlines the Company\u2019s policy regarding notifications related to workforce reductions.\n\n4.  12.2 WARN Act Notification Requirements. Subject to the exclusions outlined in 3.12.3, in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff as defined by the federal WARN Act, the Company shall provide sixty (60) calendar days advance written notice to affected employees. For the purposes of this policy and compliance with the federal WARN Act, a \"mass layoff\" is defined as a reduction in force, not resulting from a plant closing, which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if these employees represent at least 33 percent of the employees (excluding employees employed on a part-time basis); or 500 or more employees (regardless of the percentage of the employees at the site).\n\n5.  12.3 Exceptions and Conditions. Notwithstanding Section 3.12.2, the notice requirements may be reduced or eliminated under certain circumstances as explicitly provided in the federal WARN Act. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, unforeseeable business circumstances (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(A)), faltering company (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(1)), and natural disaster (as defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(b)(2)(B)). The Company will determine the applicability of these exceptions on a case-by-case basis and will document its reasoning. Furthermore, if the affected employee count is not_in the range of 50 to 499 employees, the Company will evaluate the percentage impact on the employee base, and provide 60 days notification if the number of employees affected represents at least 33 percent of the employees at the site.

We are committed to supporting our employees' needs to care for their families and manage personal health matters.\n\n**5.2.1 Eligibility Overview**\n\nSterling Innovations complies with both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Paid Family Leave (PFL). It's important to understand that FMLA provides *unpaid*, job-protected leave for up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period for qualifying reasons, such as the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or the employee's own serious health condition. FMLA applies to employees who have worked for Sterling Innovations for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before the leave, and if Sterling Innovations has 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite.\n\nCalifornia PFL, on the other hand, provides *partial wage replacement* (currently 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). To be eligible for CA PFL, you must contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI). Employees who are not SDI contributors are not eligible for PFL benefits, even if they are eligible for FMLA. If you work in California, you likely contribute to SDI, but please confirm this on your paystub. You may take PFL to care for family members NOT residing in California, so long as you otherwise meet the eligibility requirements. Note that, depending on the timing and overlap between FMLA and PFL, FMLA runs concurrently with PFL where applicable. The laws are often paired together when leave is requested."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"leave.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"Eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"duration_weeks\": 8,\n          \"wage_replacement_percentage\": \"60-70\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"California PFL, on the other hand, provides *partial wage replacement* (currently 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner).

Note that while Acme Corp. strives to create a positive and productive work environment, the provisions of this policy shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with federal standards only. This policy is effective as of January 1, 2025, and supersedes all prior policies regarding meal and rest breaks.

However, if an employee voluntarily takes a meal break of thirty (30) minutes or more, they must be fully relieved of all job duties during that period. Such a meal break shall be unpaid. An employee's decision to waive their meal break does not create an obligation for Acme Corp. to provide any compensation in lieu of the break, nor does it expose the company to any penalty. Employees who work shifts lasting eight (8) hours or more are encouraged to take a meal break in order to maintain optimal productivity.\n\n**3.5.3 Rest Breaks:** Similarly, federal law does not mandate rest breaks for adult employees. However, should Acme Corp. elect to provide rest breaks lasting five (5) to twenty (20) minutes, any such rest breaks shall be considered time worked and shall be fully compensated. The scheduling of any voluntary rest breaks is subject to the operational needs of the company and the discretion of the employee's supervisor. Refusal to take an offered rest break shall not be grounds for disciplinary action.

This policy is intended to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law governing minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nOvertime compensation will be paid to non-exempt employees as defined in Section 2.1 (\"Employee Classifications\").

The workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM.\n\nPlease note: While Acme Corp. values its employees' hard work and dedication, authorization from a supervisor is needed prior to working overtime. While unauthorized overtime work may still be compensated, it may also be subject to disciplinary action, per Section 7.3 (\"Employee Conduct and Discipline\"). Furthermore, overtime pay will be calculated based on the employee's regularly hourly rate, which excludes bonuses, commissions, and other discretionary payments as described in Section 3.3 (\"Wage Calculations\").\n\nIf an employee terminates employment with the company and is owed overtime pay, such final wages will be subject to applicable payroll deductions as outlined in section 3.5 (\"Payroll and Payment\"). Should the employee work more than 60 hours in one workweek, there must be an additional review performed by human resources. Furthermore, if an employee works less than 40 hours in a week, because of an unpaid leave such as a suspension, the employee's subsequent overtime compensation shall be reduced by the number of unpaid hours.\n\nThis policy is subject to change at Acme Corp.'s discretion.

Furthermore, double time pay applies to hours worked over eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek, provided the employee has been actively working at Starlight Technologies for more than 3 months; new hires may be exempted at the discretion of management. This policy aims to ensure compliance with California Labor Code sections 510 and 515, and any discrepancies will be interpreted in accordance with these codes. Employees must receive prior authorization from their supervisor or manager before working any overtime hours; unauthorized overtime may be subject to disciplinary action.

(hereinafter \"the Company\"). It is the Company\u2019s intent to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding overtime pay, as outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This policy applies to all non-exempt employees working within the United States.\n\n**3.4.1 Overtime Eligibility and Calculation**\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek, as defined by the FLSA. The workweek is defined as a fixed and regularly recurring period of seven consecutive 24-hour days. Any hours worked beyond 40 within this designated workweek will be compensated at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For the avoidance of doubt, an employee's classification as either exempt or non-exempt will be based on an individualized assessment of their job duties and responsibilities, in accordance with applicable federal law, as determined by Human Resources and documented in the employee's personnel file (see Policy 2.1 for classification guidelines). However, to clarify this, if an employee's hours worked weekly are at or below 40, and they are classified as non-exempt, no overtime compensation is applicable.\n\nFurthermore, it is the employee's responsibility to accurately record all hours worked, and all overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor. Failure to obtain pre-approval may result in disciplinary action, as detailed in Policy 7.2, even if the overtime hours are ultimately compensated, in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nIn instances where an employee has multiple rates of pay during a workweek, the \"weighted average\" method will be used to determine the overtime rate. Contact the Payroll Department with questions regarding rate calculations.\n\n**3.4.2 Reporting and Approval**\n\n(The remainder of this section is excluded from this generation exercise.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"lte\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime compensation\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"However, to clarify this, if an employee's hours worked weekly are at or below 40, and they are classified as non-exempt, no overtime compensation is applicable.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"XYZ Corp.

Compensation and Benefits**\n**Policy 3.2: Overtime Compensation**\n**Effective Date:** 2024-01-01\n**Revision:** 2.0\n\nIt is the policy of XYZ Corp. to compensate eligible employees for overtime hours worked, consistent with federal law. Overtime-eligible employees, defined as those classified as non-exempt per the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), will receive overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek. For the purposes of calculating overtime, the workweek is defined as Sunday at 12:00 AM to Saturday at 11:59 PM.\n\nSpecifically, an employee\u2019s time is compensable if it meets the requirements for hours worked under section 778 of the FLSA, regardless of how performance goals are reached or the employee's physical location or work schedule. However, this policy regarding overtime compensation applies exclusively to non-exempt employees, meaning any employee who is not explicitly designated as exempt is eligible for overtime. If an employee believes that they should be classified as exempt and are working over forty hours, they should refer to policy 3.1, Exempt Employee Classifications, before pursuing overtime pay. Payment will be made on the regular payday for the pay period in which the overtime was worked.\n\nIt is XYZ Corp.\u2019s policy to comply with any applicable federal regulations regarding employee compensation. If an employee works, for example, 45 hours in a workweek, they will be compensated at their regular rate for the first 40 hours worked and at 1.5 times their regular rate for the additional 5 hours worked.

More information can be found on the EDD website at [fictitious website]. See Section 3.2.5 for return-to-work requirements post-PFL.\n*   **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):** FMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. These reasons include the birth and care of a newborn child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, child, or parent), or for the employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job. To be eligible for FMLA leave at Sterling Dynamics Inc., an employee must have been employed by the company for at least twelve (12) months and must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the leave.\n\nImportantly, any employee whose employment status is 'terminated', is not eligible to file or receive paid family leave.\n\n*   **Coordination of Leave:** Employees are encouraged to utilize both PFL and FMLA concurrently where applicable.

Acme Corp is committed to complying with all applicable California Labor Laws, including Sections 201 and 202 of the California Labor Code, regarding final wage payments. This policy applies exclusively to employees whose primary work location is within California. Employees working outside of California are subject to different final pay regulations, as outlined in policy 3.4.2.\n\nThe timing of your final paycheck depends on the nature of your separation from Acme Corp.\n\n*   **Involuntary Termination:** If your employment is involuntarily terminated by Acme Corp (e.g., layoff, termination for cause), your final paycheck, including all earned but unpaid wages, overtime, and accrued vacation time, will be available to you immediately upon termination. This is in accordance with California Labor Code Section 201.\n\n*   **Voluntary Resignation with 72 Hours' Notice:** If you voluntarily resign your employment with Acme Corp and provide at least 72 hours' advance notice of your resignation date, your final paycheck will be available to you on your last day of employment. If you do not pick up the check, it will be mailed to your address of record.\n\n*   **Voluntary Resignation without 72 Hours' Notice:** If you voluntarily resign your employment with Acme Corp and fail to provide at least 72 hours' advance notice of your resignation date, your final paycheck will be available to you within 72 hours of your last day of employment.

This policy is intended to comply with all applicable California state laws.

All other Apex Solutions, Inc. policies apply in addition to, and not in lieu of, this policy.\n\n**Overtime Pay:**\n\nApex Solutions, Inc. provides overtime compensation to its non-exempt California employees as follows:\n\n*   **Daily Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday (employee.hours_worked_daily) and up to and including twelve (12) hours in any workday.\n\n*   **Double Time:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', they will be paid two (2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) hours in any workday (employee.hours_worked_daily).\n\n*   **Weekly Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt' and their employee.location_state is 'CA', and they have not already received overtime pay under the Daily Overtime provisions, they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any workweek (employee.hours_worked_weekly). Hours already compensated at the daily overtime rate are not included in the calculation of weekly overtime to avoid double-counting. This also applies for work that is not on the 7th consecutive day of the workweek.\n\n*   **Seventh Consecutive Day Overtime:** If an employee's employee.classification is 'non_exempt', their employee.location_state is 'CA', and their employee.consecutive_workdays is not_in [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"], they will be paid one and one-half (1.5) times their regular rate of pay for the first eight (8) hours worked on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek. All hours worked in excess of eight (8) on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek will be paid at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.\n\nEmployees are required to accurately record all hours worked each day.

This policy outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a plant closing or mass layoff.\n\nA \"plant closing\" refers to the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A \"mass layoff\" means a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, and which results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees if these 50 or more employees make up at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, or 500 or more employees regardless of the 33% threshold.

For the purposes of this policy, \"overtime hours\" shall mean hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, for StellarTech Solutions employees whose primary work location is in the State of California and whose employee.classification is non_exempt, \"overtime hours\" also encompass hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday, and any hours worked on a seventh (7th) consecutive day in a workweek as defined in Section 3.4.2, provided that such employees have not exceeded 40 hours in that same workweek. In situations where an employee works both daily and weekly overtime, the greater of the two amounts will be compensated, but not both, it being the intent of this policy to avoid double compensation. The rate of overtime compensation shall be one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay for all overtime hours, except as provided in California law for hours worked over twelve (12) in a workday, or over eight (8) hours on the seventh consecutive workday, which shall be compensated at two (2) times the employee's regular rate of pay. Furthermore, any employee whose employee.employment_status is terminated involuntarily and who has worked over 40 hours in a week shall not be entitled to the full payout of any accrued PTO.\n\n3.4.2. **Workweek Definition:** The StellarTech Solutions workweek is defined as commencing at 12:00 AM on Sunday and concluding at 11:59 PM on Saturday. This definition applies to all employees, regardless of location, unless superseded by a collective bargaining agreement.\n\n3.4.3. **Exempt Employees:** This policy does not apply to employees who are classified as exempt under the FLSA or California law.

This policy applies to all ACME Corp. employees in the United States, with specific provisions for employees in California due to stricter state regulations. For definitions of terms used in this policy, please refer to Section 1.2, \u201cDefinitions.\u201d\n\n**3.4.1 Federal Guidelines:**\n\nFederal law does not mandate meal or rest breaks for adult employees. However, ACME Corp. adheres to the following federal guidelines regarding breaks:\n*   Breaks lasting 5 to 20 minutes are considered working time and must be paid.\n*   Meal periods of 30 minutes or more are unpaid, provided the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities during the entire meal period.\n\n**3.4.2 California-Specific Regulations:**\n\nEmployees working in California are subject to the following additional requirements under California law:\n*   **Meal Breaks:** Employees working more than five (5) hours in a workday are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break. Employees working more than ten (10) hours in a workday are entitled to a second 30-minute unpaid meal break. These meal breaks must begin before the end of the fifth hour and tenth hour of work, respectively. Employees can waive their meal break if working no more than six (6) hours in a day, and if mutually agreed upon with the employer.\n*   **Rest Breaks:** Employees are entitled to a paid 10-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period, as practicable.\n*   **Premium Pay for Missed Breaks:** If an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, the employee is entitled to one (1) hour of premium pay for each workday that a meal or rest break is missed. Please see Section 3.4.3 for instructions on reporting missed breaks.\n\n**3.4.3 Reporting Missed Breaks:**\n\nAny employee who believes they have been denied a compliant meal or rest break should immediately report the missed break to their supervisor or Human Resources. Employees must notify HR immediately if they are not located in one of the following states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, Wyoming to ensure the company can track and remediate any missed breaks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"notify_missed_break_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"CA\",\n            \"NY\",\n            \"TX\",\n            \"FL\",\n            \"WA\",\n            \"PA\",\n            \"IL\",\n            \"OH\",\n            \"GA\",\n            \"NC\",\n            \"MI\",\n            \"NJ\",\n            \"VA\",\n            \"AZ\",\n            \"MA\",\n            \"TN\",\n            \"IN\",\n            \"MD\",\n            \"MO\",\n            \"WI\",\n            \"CO\",\n            \"MN\",\n            \"SC\",\n            \"AL\",\n            \"LA\",\n            \"KY\",\n            \"OR\",\n            \"OK\",\n            \"CT\",\n            \"UT\",\n            \"IA\",\n            \"NV\",\n            \"AR\",\n            \"MS\",\n            \"KS\",\n            \"NM\",\n            \"NE\",\n            \"ID\",\n            \"WV\",\n            \"HI\",\n            \"NH\",\n            \"ME\",\n            \"MT\",\n            \"RI\",\n            \"DE\",\n            \"SD\",\n            \"ND\",\n            \"AK\",\n            \"VT\",\n            \"WY\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"Employees must notify HR immediately if they are not located in one of the listed states.\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees must notify HR immediately if they are not located in one of the following states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, West Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, Wyoming to ensure the company can track and remediate any missed breaks.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"ACME Corp.

This policy outlines the notification requirements for mass layoffs, plant closures, and relocations as defined under these laws.\n\nAs a general rule, Acme Corp. will provide at least 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees before any plant closing or mass layoff, as required by the federal WARN Act. This requirement applies if the action results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding part-time employees, provided that the employer has 100 or more employees company-wide. Note, that for employees working in California, California\u2019s WARN Act extends similar protections, requiring notice when a covered establishment employs, or has employed within the preceding 12 months, 75 or more persons. The state act also applies when there is a mass layoff of 50 or more employees, not just employees excluding part-time ones. Because Acme Corp. operates in multiple states, should the affected employees be located in California, this stricter employee threshold of 75 employees applies in that circumstance and the part-time employee exclusion does not apply. Note that the 75 employee rule applies to the total number of employees employed by the company. For clarity, a \"mass layoff\" is defined under the federal WARN act as a reduction in force that is not the result of a plant closing and that results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, if those 50 or more employees represent at least 33 percent of the employees at the single site of employment. See Section 1.03 \"Definitions\" for further clarification.

Both laws may apply to you depending on your circumstances and location.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. FMLA applies to employers with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Reasons for leave include the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, or parent), or for your own serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job. For more detailed information, refer to the official FMLA guidelines.\n\nCalifornia Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California employees who take time off work to bond with a new child (birth, adoption, or foster care placement) or to care for a seriously ill family member (child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or registered domestic partner). If you work in California, contribute to California State Disability Insurance (SDI), and request leave for bonding with a new child, you are entitled to receive approximately 60-70% of your wages for up to 8 weeks through PFL.

It is our intention to fully comply with all applicable federal and state laws, including those specific to California. This policy applies to all active employees of Sterling Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Please refer to Section 1.2 (Definitions) for clarification of terms used herein.\n\n**3.4.1 General Guidelines**\n\nSterling Solutions, Inc. provides meal and rest breaks to employees as required by law. The following guidelines apply:\n\n*   **Federal Law:** Under federal law, Sterling Solutions, Inc. is not required to provide meal or rest breaks to employees. However, when breaks of short duration (usually lasting from 5 to 20 minutes) are offered, Sterling Solutions, Inc. will compensate its employees for such time. Any meal periods lasting 30 minutes or more will be unpaid, provided that the employee is completely relieved of their duties during the meal period.\n\n*   **California Law:** For employees working in California, California law mandates specific meal and rest break requirements. Employees are entitled to a 30-minute unpaid meal break if they work more than five (5) hours in a workday. A second 30-minute unpaid meal break is required if an employee works more than ten (10) hours in a workday. Employees are also entitled to a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Sterling Solutions, Inc. will follow all legal requirements regarding timing of these breaks.\n\n*   **Termination:** If an employee in California is not provided a required meal or rest break as mandated by California law, and it is demonstrated that this failure to provide the break was a willful violation by the company, that employee will be immediately terminated for cause and is ineligible for rehire at any Sterling Solutions, Inc. location. Any termination under this rule will be subject to review by the HR Director and Legal Counsel.\n\n*   **Recording Breaks:** All employees, especially those working in California, must accurately record their meal and rest breaks in the designated timekeeping system.\n\nQuestions regarding this policy should be directed to the Human Resources Department."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"break_california_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"meal\",\n            \"rest\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"immediate termination for cause and ineligibility for rehire\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If an employee in California is not provided a required meal or rest break as mandated by California law, and it is demonstrated that this failure to provide the break was a willful violation by the company, that employee will be immediately terminated for cause and is ineligible for rehire at any Sterling Solutions, Inc. location.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Meal and Rest Breaks\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act is a federal law designed to protect workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide notification 60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs. This policy outlines Acme Corp's obligations under the federal WARN Act. Note this policy adheres only to the federal requirements, and does not provide additional or differing requirements of any state.\n\n**3.12.1 WARN Act Notification Requirements**\n\nAcme Corp will provide advance written notice of a plant closing or mass layoff as required by the federal WARN Act. A *plant closing* is defined as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees, excluding any part-time employees. A *mass layoff* is defined as a reduction in force which is not the result of a plant closing, but results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees and represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, excluding any part-time employees, or 500 or more employees are affected regardless of percentage. For the purposes of this policy, *employment loss* means (1) an employment termination, other than a discharge for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement; (2) a layoff exceeding 6 months; or (3) a reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during each month of any 6-month period.\n\nTherefore, Acme Corp will notify affected employees 60 calendar days in advance of a mass layoff if the number of affected employees in that mass layoff is greater than or equal to 50 and also represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, OR the number of affected employees is greater than or equal to 500, given the employer has 100 or more employees.\n\n**3.12.2 Notice Content**\n\nThe WARN notice will include, but is not limited to, the following information: the name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoff will occur; the nature of the planned action; the expected date of the first separation; a statement as to whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary; the job titles of positions to be affected and the number of affected employees in each job classification; and contact information for company officials to contact for further information.\n\n**3.12.3 Exceptions**\n\n[Further exceptions would be detailed here, such as unforeseen business circumstances, natural disaster exceptions, etc. - not included as requested]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"warn_act_notification_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"layoff.affected_employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 500\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 100\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"affected employees\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Therefore, Acme Corp will notify affected employees 60 calendar days in advance of a mass layoff if the number of affected employees in that mass layoff is greater than or equal to 50 and also represents at least 33% of the employees at the single site of employment, OR the number of affected employees is greater than or equal to 500, given the employer has 100 or more employees.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Workforce Reductions and the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-01-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}

This policy outlines our approach to Family and Medical Leave, complying with both federal and California state law where applicable.\n\n**5.2.1 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**\n\nEligible employees may be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for qualifying reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member (as defined by the FMLA), or the employee's own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been employed by Bright Future Corp. for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave commencement date. Further, Bright Future Corp. must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. FMLA leave runs concurrently with other applicable leaves, such as California Paid Family Leave (PFL), when the reason for leave qualifies under both statutes.\n\n**5.2.2 California Paid Family Leave (PFL)**\n\nFor employees who pay into California State Disability Insurance (SDI), California Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides partial wage replacement benefits. Generally, PFL provides up to eight weeks of partial wage replacement (approximately 60-70% of wages, subject to change per state law) for bonding with a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. However, if an employee's work location is not California or the employee's employment status is either terminated or resigned, they are not eligible for PFL benefits through Bright Future Corp, and should directly consult California state regulations for possible benefits eligibility. Coordination with FMLA leave is mandatory; the employee must simultaneously apply for both leaves if eligible.\n\n**5.2.3 Interplay of FMLA and PFL**\n\nIt is Bright Future Corp.\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding family and medical leave. Employees are encouraged to consult with the Human Resources Department to determine their eligibility and understand the interplay of FMLA and PFL benefits.

Acme Corp. is committed to ensuring accurate and timely payment of all wages owed to its employees. This policy applies to all employees, regardless of employment status, classification, or location, though specific requirements may vary based on applicable state law. (See Section 1.01 for Definitions).\n\n**3.12.1 General Policy**\n\nFinal paychecks will include all earned and unpaid wages, including but not limited to regular wages, accrued vacation time (subject to Policy 4.02 regarding vacation accrual and payout), and any other earned bonuses or commissions. Acme Corp. will generally adhere to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for final paycheck timing, which mandates payment by the next regularly scheduled payday. However, recognizing the stricter requirements of certain states, Acme Corp. will comply with state law where it provides a greater benefit to the employee.\n\n**3.12.2 California Employees**\n\nFor employees whose primary work location is in the State of California, the following policy applies, supplementing the general policy outlined in Section 3.12.1. If an employee is involuntarily terminated from Acme Corp, all earned wages are due and payable *immediately* at the time of termination. In the event that Acme Corp is unable to provide a physical check immediately at the point of termination, a final paycheck will be made available at the employee's designated mailing address, and mailed via USPS First Class within 24 hours. This accelerated timeline supersedes the federal next-regular-payday rule outlined above.\n\n**3.12.3 Resignation**\n\nFor voluntary resignations, the timing of the final paycheck depends on the amount of notice provided.

Federal law generally dictates that final paychecks must be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday. However, California Labor Code Sections 201 and 202 provide specific requirements for the timing of final wage payments. Therefore, this policy is tailored to comply with California law for all active California employees.\n\nFinal paychecks for employees who voluntarily resign must be available no later than 72 hours after their last day of work, provided that reasonable notice of their intent to resign has been provided. *Reasonable notice* is defined as providing at least 72 hours advance notice. Should an employee fail to provide such notice, the final paycheck will be available within 72 hours of the employee\u2019s last day of employment. However, if an employee resigns with less than 72 hours' notice but specifically requests their final paycheck to be available on their last day of work, Apex Industries will endeavor to accommodate this request where feasible, but cannot guarantee its fulfillment, and payment will be issued no later than 72 hours after the last day.\n\nIn cases of involuntary termination, including layoff, final paychecks will be made available to the employee immediately upon separation. The final paycheck will include all earned but unpaid wages, including any accrued and unused vacation time (refer to Section 4.5, Vacation Policy). If an immediate paycheck is impossible due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., payroll processing limitations, system outages), Apex Industries will make every effort to provide the final paycheck as soon as possible, but no later than is legally permissible under applicable state laws. Questions regarding the payment of final wages should be directed to the HR department.

This policy outlines the company\u2019s obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (both federal and California-specific) and how we strive to exceed these requirements.\n\n**WARN Act Notification:**\n\nAcme Corp. will provide written notice to affected employees at least 60 calendar days before any plant closing or mass layoff as defined by the federal WARN Act or the California WARN Act, whichever provides greater protection to the employee. A \"mass layoff\" under federal law is defined as a reduction in force (not due to a plant closing) which results in an employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period for at least 50 employees if those 50 employees represent at least 33% of the active workforce at the single site of employment, or 500 employees regardless of percentage. The California WARN Act, however, defines a mass layoff more broadly as the termination of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period.

Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.4: Overtime Compensation**\n**Effective Date: 2024-01-01**\n**Revision: 1.2**\n\n3.4.1. **General Overtime Policy.** Acme Corp. adheres to the overtime provisions set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Non-exempt employees, as defined under the FLSA, shall be eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek. This policy applies to all employees working within the United States, irrespective of the employee's location or any applicable state laws concerning overtime. Specifically, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Acme Corp. only observes the minimum requirements under the FLSA and does not afford any additional overtime compensation, even if applicable local laws mandate otherwise.\n\n3.4.2. **Conditions for Overtime Eligibility.** To qualify for overtime compensation under this policy, an employee must be classified as non-exempt, maintain an active employment status, and must have worked more than forty (40) hours within the workweek. Furthermore, overtime compensation will only be paid for hours that the employee has been explicitly authorized to work by their direct supervisor. Any hours worked without prior authorization may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Overtime calculations shall be based on the actual hours worked, excluding any paid time off such as vacation, sick leave, or holidays. Note, nothing in this policy guarantees any employee a minimum number of work hours, overtime or otherwise, and Acme Corp. retains the discretion to adjust work schedules as needed. For purposes of clarity, Section 3.4.1 shall supersede any conflicting provisions regarding time-off compensation calculations detailed in Section 4.2.\n\n3.4.3. **Tracking and Reporting.** It is the responsibility of each employee to accurately track and report all hours worked each day, including any overtime hours. Employees are required to submit their timesheets for approval by their supervisor no later than the designated time each week. False or inaccurate reporting of hours worked may result in disciplinary action."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.employment_status\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"active\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_weekly\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 40\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"overtime pay at 1.5x regular hourly rate\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Non-exempt employees, as defined under the FLSA, shall be eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a single workweek.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_authorization_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"explicit authorization from direct supervisor for overtime hours\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Furthermore, overtime compensation will only be paid for hours that the employee has been explicitly authorized to work by their direct supervisor.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"overtime_no_state_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"restriction\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"deny\",\n        \"subject\": \"additional overtime compensation mandated by local laws\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Specifically, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Acme Corp. only observes the minimum requirements under the FLSA and does not afford any additional overtime compensation, even if applicable local laws mandate otherwise.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Because TechForward values its employees and adheres to all applicable labor laws, this policy explains when and how employees will be compensated for overtime work. This policy specifically applies to employees whose primary work location is in the State of California. (See Policy 1.1: Geographic Scope of Policies).\n\n**Overtime Pay**\n\nIn California, overtime is generally defined as any hours actually worked beyond eight (8) hours in a single workday or forty (40) hours in a single workweek, as described below. TechForward\u2019s standard workweek runs from Monday at 12:00 AM to Sunday at 11:59 PM. The rate of pay for overtime work is one and one-half (1.5) times the employee's regular rate of pay. For employees whose primary location is in California and who are classified as non-exempt, if an employee works more than eight hours in a workday or more than forty hours in a workweek, the employee is entitled to overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay. Employees who are classified as exempt are not eligible for overtime pay. Employees must accurately record their time worked each day, including all start and stop times, and submit their timesheets in accordance with Policy 3.3: Timekeeping. Failure to accurately record time worked may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nPlease note that while federal law also requires overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, California law is more protective of employee rights, and this policy is based on California law.

However, for employees who are involuntarily terminated as defined in Section 1.2 Definitions, and have completed at least twelve (12) months of continuous service with Acme Corp, the final paycheck will be made available for pick-up at the employee\u2019s primary worksite within 72 hours of termination, provided the Payroll Department receives notification of the termination prior to 12:00 PM Pacific Time on the employee\u2019s last day of work. If notification is received after this time, the paycheck will be available within 72 hours from the start of the next business day.

These requirements do *not* apply to employees based outside of California, or to employees classified as exempt under applicable wage and hour laws.\n\n**3.4.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nAcme Corp. provides meal breaks to ensure the health and well-being of its employees. In compliance with California Labor Code Section 512, if you are a non-exempt employee working in California and your shift is longer than five (5) hours, you are entitled to a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This meal break must begin before the end of your fifth (5th) hour of work. If your shift is longer than ten (10) hours, you are entitled to a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break. This second meal break must begin before the end of your tenth (10th) hour of work. You must be completely relieved of all duties during your meal break. You should not be expected or required to perform any work, whether active or inactive, during this time. Failure to provide the required meal breaks may result in premium pay, as outlined in Section 3.4.3. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal breaks in the timekeeping system. If an employee voluntarily chooses to work through their meal period, the employee must notify their supervisor prior to the start of the shift. If a non-exempt employee is working in California and employee.shift_hours is greater than 5, employee is entitled to a 30 minute unpaid meal break.\n\n**3.4.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nEmployees are entitled to a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks should, if possible, be taken in the middle of the work period.\n\n**3.4.3 Premium Pay for Missed Breaks**\n\nIn accordance with California law, if an employee is not provided with a compliant meal or rest break, Acme Corp. will pay the employee one (1) hour of pay at the employee\u2019s regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal or rest break is not provided."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_eligibility_ca\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"meal break\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If a non-exempt employee is working in California and employee.shift_hours is greater than 5, employee is entitled to a 30 minute unpaid meal break.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.

Furthermore, FMLA leave is only available if Acme Corp. employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of the employee's worksite. Requests for leave exceeding 12 weeks may be considered under Section 3.5: Extended Leave, but such leave will be at the discretion of the company and subject to business needs.

This policy is designed to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements while providing employees with adequate opportunities for rest and refreshment during their workdays.\n\n**3.4.2 Applicability**\nThis policy applies to all Acme Corp. employees working within the United States. Where state or local law provides greater protection or benefits to employees than federal law, Acme Corp. will comply with the applicable state or local law.\n\n**3.4.3 Meal Breaks**\n(a) Employees working in California: In accordance with California law, all non-exempt employees working shifts longer than five (5) hours shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal break.

The California WARN Act requires employers with 75 or more employees (including both full-time and part-time employees) to provide 60 calendar days' advance written notice to affected employees before any mass layoff, plant closure, or relocation. A \"mass layoff\" under California law is defined as a layoff during any 30-day period of 50 or more employees at a covered establishment. Therefore, if Acme Corp employs 75 or more individuals and a planned layoff will affect 50 or more employees at a single location within California within a 30-day period, then Acme Corp is required to provide written notification to the affected employees at least 60 days prior to the layoff date. This notice will include information about the layoff, including its expected duration, the reason for the layoff, and contact information for relevant resources. See Section 3.5 (Severance Benefits) for additional information regarding potential severance payments in the event of a layoff.

This meal period shall commence no later than the end of the employee's fifth (5th) hour of work, except where the employee's total hours worked do not exceed six (6) hours, and both the employer and employee mutually consent, in writing, to waive the meal period. Further, California employees working over ten (10) hours in a workday shall be provided a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period, again to commence no later than the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work, unless the employee works no more than twelve (12) hours and the second meal period is waived by mutual written consent. For non-California based employees, this section notwithstanding, NovaTech Solutions will provide the same break schedule as above when employee.hours_worked_daily exceeds 8, contingent upon managerial approval.\n\n3.4.3 Rest Breaks: Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7, California-based non-exempt employees shall be provided with a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. Rest breaks shall, insofar as is practicable, be taken in the middle of each work period. NovaTech Solutions may, at its discretion, mandate rest break schedules for operational efficiency. Note: Breaks should be taken, and not skipped for earlier departure.\n\n3.4.4 Missed Breaks: In the event a meal or rest period is not provided in accordance with applicable law, NovaTech Solutions shall provide one (1) hour of premium pay to the affected employee, in compliance with California Labor Code Section 226.7."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_ca_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 5\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee must be provided a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"In accordance with California Labor Code Sections 512, employees who work more than five (5) hours in a workday in California shall be provided with a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_ca_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee must be provided a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"meal\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 30\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Further, California employees working over ten (10) hours in a workday shall be provided a second thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period, again to commence no later than the end of the employee's tenth (10th) hour of work, unless the employee works no more than twelve (12) hours and the second meal period is waived by mutual written consent.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"rest_break_ca_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.shift_hours\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 4\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee must be provided with a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"break.type\": \"rest\",\n          \"break.duration_minutes\": 10\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Pursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.7, California-based non-exempt employees shall be provided with a paid ten (10) minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_non_ca_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_daily\",\n          \"operator\": \"gt\",\n          \"value\": 8\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"employee must be provided the same break schedule as above\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"For non-California based employees, this section notwithstanding, NovaTech Solutions will provide the same break schedule as above when employee.hours_worked_daily exceeds 8, contingent upon managerial approval.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"medium\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Employee Handbook\",\n    \"effective_date\": \"2024-07-01\",\n    \"applicable_jurisdictions\": [\n      \"CA\",\n      \"federal\"\n    ]\n  }\n}"}]}
