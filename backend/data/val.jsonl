Employee Handbook**\n**Section 3.2: Meal and Rest Breaks**\n**Revision Date:** 2024-10-26\n**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01\n\nAcme Corp. is committed to providing employees with appropriate meal and rest breaks in accordance with applicable law. This policy outlines the requirements for meal and rest breaks for non-exempt employees, recognizing that break requirements may vary based on employee location and hours worked.\n\n**3.2.1 Meal Breaks**\n\nGenerally, non-exempt employees are eligible for a meal break. If a non-exempt employee works more than five (5) hours in a workday, they are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes, during which time they must be completely relieved of all duties. For employees working in California, if a shift exceeds ten (10) hours, a second meal break of at least thirty (30) minutes is also required, unless the employee and employer mutually agree to waive the second meal period provided the first meal period was not waived and the employee works no more than twelve (12) hours. This waiver provision does not apply in all states, and the requirement for the second meal period persists in states outside of California. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal breaks. Failure to take or accurately record a meal break may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, particularly if such failure results in a violation of applicable state or federal law. Please consult with your manager if you have questions regarding meal break requirements, referencing also Policy 1.1 regarding \"Employee Responsibilities for Timekeeping.\"\n\n**3.2.2 Rest Breaks**\n\nNon-exempt employees are generally entitled to a paid rest break of at least ten (10) minutes for every four (4) hours worked, or major fraction thereof. While federal law does not mandate rest breaks, Acme Corp. provides these breaks as a matter of policy. In California, these rest breaks must be provided, and employees must be relieved of all duties during these breaks. As with meal breaks, failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action, including termination. Employees who feel they have been denied a rest or meal break should immediately notify their manager and Human Resources."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_violation_termination_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"meal\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Failure to take or accurately record a meal break may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, particularly if such failure results in a violation of applicable state or federal law.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"rest_break_violation_termination_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"termination\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"rest\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"disciplinary action, including termination\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"As with meal breaks, failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action, including termination.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"notify_break_violation_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"non_exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"not_in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"medical\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"notify\",\n        \"subject\": \"manager and Human Resources\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees who feel they have been denied a rest or meal break should immediately notify their manager and Human Resources.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"policy_name\": \"Acme Corp.
