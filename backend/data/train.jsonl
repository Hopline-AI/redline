We aim to support our employees while complying with all applicable laws.\n\n**3.2.1 Eligibility and Coordination:**\n\nEmployees working in California who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL). PFL provides partial wage replacement (typically 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks when you need time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member. Eligibility for PFL is determined by the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), not Acme Corp. Details on SDI contribution can be found in Section 4.5.\n\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) also provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of *unpaid*, job-protected leave for similar reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a seriously ill family member, or your own serious health condition. To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive) and at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before your leave starts and Acme Corp must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite. FMLA leave runs concurrently with PFL. This means that if you are approved for 8 weeks of PFL, those 8 weeks also count towards your 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n\nHowever, if you do NOT contribute to SDI (for example, if you are a highly compensated employee who has opted out, where allowed), you will not be eligible for CA Paid Family Leave, but you *may* still be eligible for unpaid FMLA leave, provided you meet the federal eligibility requirements.\n\nFor complete information on PFL, please visit the EDD website (www.edd.ca.gov). For FMLA details, please consult the Department of Labor website (www.dol.gov)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_eligibility_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for California Paid Family Leave (PFL)\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"Employees working in California who contribute to State Disability Insurance (SDI) are generally eligible for California Paid Family Leave (PFL).\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"ca_pfl_compensation_002\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.leave_type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.sdi_contributor\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": true\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"partial wage replacement (typically 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks under PFL\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"PFL provides partial wage replacement (typically 60-70% of your usual wages) for up to 8 weeks when you need time off to bond with a new child or care for a seriously ill family member.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"fmla_eligibility_003\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"eligibility\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.tenure_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 12\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.hours_worked_12_months\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 1250\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employer.employee_count_within_75_miles\",\n          \"operator\": \"gte\",\n          \"value\": 50\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"grant\",\n        \"subject\": \"eligibility for FMLA\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"To be eligible for FMLA, you must have worked for Acme Corp for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive) and at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before your leave starts and Acme Corp must employ 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius of your worksite.\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"pfl_fmla_concurrent_004\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"leave\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.leave_type\",\n          \"operator\": \"in\",\n          \"value\": [\n            \"family\",\n            \"parental\",\n            \"bonding\",\n            \"caregiver\",\n            \"medical\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"FMLA leave runs concurrently with PFL\",\n        \"parameters\": {}\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"FMLA leave runs concurrently with PFL.

This policy is intended to provide clarity and guidance to all employees regarding their break entitlements. However, employees are responsible for understanding and adhering to the specific requirements applicable to their location and employment classification.\n\n**(a) Meal Breaks:** Generally, for non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding five (5) hours, a thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break is required. In California, a second thirty (30)-minute unpaid meal break is required for non-exempt employees working shifts exceeding ten (10) hours. However, employees who have worked less than 6 hours, may mutually agree with their supervisor to waive this meal break. All meal breaks must be taken in a manner that fully relieves the employee of all duties. If operational needs necessitate that a non-exempt employee in California does not receive their legally mandated meal break, the employee must promptly notify their supervisor. According to California law, Acme Corp will provide one (1) hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that a meal break is not provided. This does not apply to employees who are exempt or who are not working in California. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their meal breaks in the company's timekeeping system, and discrepancies should be immediately reported to their manager. This policy does not authorize compensatory time off.\n\n**(b) Rest Breaks:** Acme Corp grants a paid ten (10)-minute rest break for every four (4) hours worked by non-exempt employees. However, an employee is only entitled to such rest break if working in California, and that if their employment status is active. To ensure the adequate staff coverage for company operations, rest breaks may be scheduled at the discretion of the supervisor. Note that federal law is silent on mandatory rest break requirements for adult employees. In compliance with state law, rest breaks must be taken in the middle of each four-hour work period."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"rule_id\": \"meal_break_premium_pay_001\",\n      \"rule_type\": \"compensation\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.location_state\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"CA\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"employee.classification\",\n          \"operator\": \"neq\",\n          \"value\": \"exempt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.type\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": \"meal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"field\": \"break.duration_minutes\",\n          \"operator\": \"eq\",\n          \"value\": 0\n        }\n      ],\n      \"condition_logic\": \"all\",\n      \"action\": {\n        \"type\": \"require\",\n        \"subject\": \"premium pay\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"amount\": \"one hour of premium pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"source_text\": \"If operational needs necessitate that a non-exempt employee in California does not receive their legally mandated meal break, the employee must promptly notify their supervisor.

This policy applies to all employees in the United States and is governed by federal law, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nIt is the policy of GlobalTech Solutions, Inc. to ensure that all employees receive their final paycheck in a timely manner, in accordance with applicable federal regulations. All final paychecks will include all earned but unpaid wages, including salary, hourly wages, accrued and unused vacation time (as outlined in Section 5.0, Vacation Policy), and any other earned compensation. Deductions will be made for all applicable taxes, withholdings, and authorized employee contributions.\n\n*   **Timing of Final Paycheck:** Generally, a terminated employee\u2019s final paycheck will be available on the next regularly scheduled payday following the date of termination. However, if an employee\u2019s employment status is not \u2018active\u2019 and the employee is classified as \u2018non_exempt\u2019, then the final paycheck will be issued no later than the next regular pay date following termination.

It is important to note that this policy is governed by federal law, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and does not supersede any state or local laws that may provide for different requirements. (See also Policy 3.1, \"Regular Paychecks\").\n\nGenerally, OptiCorp aims to provide final paychecks to departing employees in a timely manner, consistent with applicable federal regulations. The timing of the final paycheck depends on several factors, including the employee's classification (exempt or non-exempt) and the reason for termination. In most circumstances, and subject to the exceptions detailed below, an employee's final paycheck, inclusive of all accrued but unused vacation time as described in Policy 4.5, \"Vacation Accrual and Usage,\" will be issued on the next regularly scheduled payday following the employee's last day of employment.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, if an employee is terminated due to a company-wide reduction in force (RIF) affecting more than 50 employees as designated under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, and the employee\u2019s last day of employment falls within the last five business days of a pay period, the company may issue the final paycheck on the subsequent payday immediately after the standard next payday. This exception is designed to accommodate the complexities of large-scale RIF events and ensure accurate payroll processing.
